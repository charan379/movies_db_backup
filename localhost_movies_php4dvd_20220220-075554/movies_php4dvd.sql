One story line moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time.\r\n-\r\nScion013\r\n\r\nA memory inside a memory, Memento is a complicated head spinning adventure. Leonard is determined to avenge his wife\'s murder. However, unable to remember anything that happens day-to-day due to a condition he sustained, short term memory loss, he has to write himself note after note that still don\'t mean anything after he falls asleep. The film goes back in time to reveal each little bit of the puzzle as he tries to find out the person who killed his wife and makes the audience feel just as confused as he is. The narrative closely follows a phone call Pearce has in which he talks about Sammy Jankis a former client of his who he believed had the same condition. The film takes an unexpected twist as the two characters have a lot more in common than is initially put across.\r\n-\r\ngab_b270@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nLeonard Shelby has short term memory loss resulting from an injury he sustained which was associated with the murder of his wife. He remembers his life prior to the incident, such as being an insurance claims investigator. He has learned to cope with his memory loss through dealing with a man named Sammy Jankis, a person he investigated professionally who also had short term memory issues. Some of these coping mechanism are to have a system of where to place things, talk to people face-to-face if possible rather than on the telephone as to be able to gauge their true intention, take Polaroids and write copious notes, the most important of those which he tattoos on his body so that they become permanent. Leonard\'s current mission is to find and kill his wife\'s murderer, who he believes is a man named John G., a name which is tattooed on his body. Over the course of a day, Leonard is assisted in this mission by a few people seemingly independent of each other, including a man named Teddy and a woman named Natalie. However, each time he meets them, he has no idea who they are, why they are helping him and if indeed they are working toward the same goal as him.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nLeonard is an insurance investigator whose memory has been damaged following a head injury he sustained after intervening on his wife\'s murder. His quality of life has been severely hampered after this event, and he can now only live a comprehendable life by tattooing notes on himself and taking pictures of things with a Polaroid camera. The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters. Leonard badly wants revenge for his wife\'s murder, but, as numerous characters explain, there may be little point if he won\'t remember it in order to provide closure for him. The movie veers between these future occurrences and a telephone conversation Leonard is having in his motel room in which he compares his current state to that of a client whose claim he once dealt with.\r\n-\r\n\r\nPoint blank in the head a man shoots another. In flashbacks, each one earlier in time than what we\'ve just seen, the two men\'s pasts unfold. Leonard, as a result of a blow to the head during an assault on his wife, has no short-term memory. He\'s looking for his wife\'s killer, compensating for his disability by taking Polaroids, annotating them and tattooing important facts on his body. We meet the loquacious Teddy and the seductive Natalie (a barmaid who promises to help) and we glimpse Leonard\'s wife through memories from before the assault. Leonard also talks about Sammy Jankis, a man he knew with a similar condition. Has Leonard found the killer? Who\'s manipulating whom?\r\n-','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 07:04:44','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbbZ2zTBR_g','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::14\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',12),(3,'1375666','Inception','Inception','Inception\r\nEl origen\r\nA Origem\r\nГенезис\r\nOrigine\r\n盗梦空间\r\nPočetak\r\nPočátek\r\nAlgus\r\nDasatskisi\r\nΟι ονειροπαγιδευτές\r\n潛行凶間\r\nEredet\r\nChakravuyh\r\nAghaz Ideh\r\nHat\'hala\r\nインセプション\r\nPirmsākums\r\nPradžia\r\nIncepcja\r\nÎnceputul\r\nНачало\r\nПочетак\r\nPočiatok\r\nIzvor\r\nOrigen\r\n全面啟動\r\nJit Phi Khat Lôk\r\nBaşlangıç\r\nПочаток\r\nOliver\'s Arrow\r\nInception: The IMAX Experience\r\nMuqaddima\r\nKẻ Đánh Cắp Giấc Mơ',2010,148,8.8,2231362,'English\r\nJapanese\r\nFrench','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Christopher Nolan','Christopher Nolan','Zakaria Alaoui\r\nJohn Bernard\r\nChris Brigham\r\nJordan Goldberg\r\nThomas Hayslip\r\nChristopher Nolan\r\nKanjirô Sakura\r\nYoshikuni Taki\r\nEmma Thomas\r\nThomas Tull','Hans Zimmer','Leonardo DiCaprio\r\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\r\nElliot Page\r\nTom Hardy\r\nKen Watanabe\r\nDileep Rao\r\nCillian Murphy\r\nTom Berenger\r\nMarion Cotillard\r\nPete Postlethwaite\r\nMichael Caine\r\nLukas Haas\r\nTai-Li Lee\r\nClaire Geare\r\nMagnus Nolan\r\nTaylor Geare\r\nJohnathan Geare\r\nTohoru Masamune\r\nYuji Okumoto\r\nEarl Cameron\r\nRyan Hayward\r\nMiranda Nolan\r\nRuss Fega\r\nTim Kelleher\r\nTalulah Riley\r\nNicolas Clerc\r\nCoralie Dedykere\r\nSilvie Laguna\r\nVirgile Bramly\r\nJean-Michel Dagory\r\nHelena Cullinan\r\nMark Fleischmann\r\nShelley Lang\r\nAdam Cole\r\nJack Murray\r\nKraig Thornber\r\nAngela Nathenson\r\nNatasha Beaumont\r\nMarc Raducci\r\nCarl Gilliard\r\nJill Maddrell\r\nAlex Lombard\r\nNicole Pulliam\r\nPeter Basham\r\nMichael Gaston\r\nFelix Scott\r\nAndrew Pleavin\r\nLisa Reynolds\r\nJason Tendell\r\nJack Gilroy\r\nShannon Welles\r\nMichael August\r\nKen Bhan\r\nHélène Cardona\r\nJohn Ceallach\r\nGregg Christie\r\nGarvin Cross\r\nJames Currie\r\nYoulanda Davis\r\nJulie Eagleton\r\nSeve Esposito\r\nMarcus Everett\r\nZachary Christopher Fay\r\nDaniel Girondeaud\r\nNatalie Goldwin\r\nAllan Hale\r\nAndrew Hoagland\r\nGuy Iannacone\r\nMarguerite Gioia Insolia\r\nCharles Jarrell\r\nSeong-hwan Jo\r\nAlonzo F.

Cobb\'s rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros. Pictures\r\n\r\nDominic Cobb is an spy who instead of breaking into a person\'s home, office, or even computer, gets the information he needs by getting into the person\'s mind through their dreams. Cobb is also a fugitive who misses his children. Someone approaches Cobb and wants to hire him but instead of getting information out, the man wants Cobb to implant something, a process called \"inception\", which is not easy to do. Cobb is hesitant to do it, but when the man offers to help Cobb go back to his children, Cobb agrees. So he assembles his team but when they begin, there are things Cobb didn\'t tell his team that could jeopardize the job, and when they occur, they\'re not sure if they should continue.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nDominic Cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic science of extraction, inserting oneself into a subject\'s dreams to obtain hidden information without the subject knowing, a concept taught to him by his professor father-in-law, Dr. Stephen Miles. Dom\'s associates are Miles\' former students, who Dom requires as he has given up being the dream architect for reasons he won\'t disclose. Dom\'s primary associate, Arthur, believes it has something to do with Dom\'s deceased wife, Mal, who often figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom\'s want to \"go home\" (get back to his own reality, which includes two young children). Dom\'s work is generally in corporate espionage. As the subjects don\'t want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. Dom is also a wanted man, as many of his past subjects have learned what Dom has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. Saito, offers Dom a job he can\'t refuse: to take the concept one step further into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject\'s dreams without them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that person as a being. Saito\'s target is Robert Michael Fischer, the heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. Beyond the complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and some unknowns concerning Fischer, the biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which Cobb fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the job, and Cobb\'s newest associate Ariadne\'s belief that Cobb\'s own subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking over what happens in the dreams.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb a unique con artist can enter anyone\'s dreams and extract the most valuable ideas and secrets of people with the help of \"inception\" (a dream sharing technology) when the state of mind is at its vulnerable best. Cobbs ability has made him the face of corporate spying, hence a wanted man too. Seeing his abilities, he is approached by Saito to carry out an almost impossible mission not to steal, but to plant the idea into the mind of the legal heir of a billion dollar enterprenauer. Mr. Cobb, with some specialists, must do the impossible in order to get back his life in a completely different \"world of dreams\" facing his own demons.\r\n-\r\nMahesh Shelatkar\r\n\r\nDom Cobb is a thief with the rare ability to enter people\'s dreams and steal their secrets from their subconsciouses. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage, but has also cost him everything he loves.

He is at the event of his daughter\'s wedding. Michael, Vito\'s youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don\'s influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito\'s fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nMichael, the young and idealistic son of Vito Corleone, the head of the most powerful Mafia clan in New York, returns home as a war hero and is determined to live his own life. But tragic circumstances make him face the legacy of his family.\r\n-\r\nfiveisforsecret\r\n\r\nThe story begins as \"Don\" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia \"family\", oversees his daughter\'s wedding with his wife Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father\'s business. Through Michael\'s life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don\'t want to follow the old ways and look out for community and \"family\". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don\'s influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don\'s fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family.\r\n-\r\nCharlie Ness\r\n\r\nVito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael\'s sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael\'s family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don\'s lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.\r\n-\r\nTheElfstone','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 10:19:03','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8JJZQakY','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/18\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG12\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::14\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nWest Germany::16',18),(5,'0071562','The Godfather: Part II','Godfather: Part II','The Godfather: Part II\r\nKumbari: Pjesa II\r\nEl Padrino 2ª Parte\r\nEl Padrino: Parte II\r\nDer Pate 2\r\nO Poderoso Chefão II\r\nO Poderoso Chefão: Parte 2\r\nКръстникът II\r\nLe parrain II\r\nEl padrino II\r\n教父2\r\nEl padrino: Parte II\r\nKum 2\r\nKmotr II\r\nKrstný Otec II\r\nGodfather del 2\r\nAl-arraab 2\r\nAl abb Alrohy: aljoz\' II\r\nRistiisa: II osa\r\nRistiisa 2\r\nKummisetä II\r\nKummisetä osa II\r\nKummisetä Osa II\r\nLe Parrain, 2ème partie\r\nLe Parrain, 2ᵉ partie\r\nO nonos, meros 2o\r\nΟ νονός, μέρος 2ο\r\nO nonos 2\r\nA keresztapa II\r\nGuðfaðirinn: Hluti 2\r\nPedar khandeh 2\r\nIl padrino - Parte II\r\nGodfather Part II\r\nゴッドファーザーPARTII\r\nKrusttēvs 2\r\nKrikštatėvis II\r\nDe peetvader: Deel II\r\nGudfaren 2\r\nOjciec chrzestny II\r\nO Padrinho: Parte II\r\nNașul: Partea a II-a\r\nКрёстный отец 2\r\nКум 2\r\nBoter, II. del\r\nDae bu II\r\nКрестный отец 2\r\nEl padrí II\r\nGudfadern del II\r\n教父第二集\r\nBaba 2\r\nХрещений батько 2\r\nХрещений батько II\r\nХрещений батько: Частина друга\r\nХрещений батько.

Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael\'s interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli\'s turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael\'s and a long- time ally of Michael\'s father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An attempted assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael\'s life, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile. Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nThe childhood of Vito Corleone and his rise from a petty criminal to the most powerful don in New York City during the early 20th century is depicted, whilst his son Don Michael Corleone succumbs to power, greed, and ruthlessness, all for the sake of pride and keeping the Corleone family intact.\r\n-\r\ngoddangwatir','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 10:20:46','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8JJZQakY','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::18\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::12\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+\r\nWest Germany::16',18),(6,'0099674','The Godfather: Part III','Godfather: Part III','The Godfather: Part III\r\nKumbari: Pjesa 3\r\nEl Padrino: Parte III\r\nEl Padrino Epílogo: La muerte de Michael Corleone\r\nDer Pate 3\r\nO Poderoso Chefão III\r\nO PODEROSO CHEFÃO de Mario Puzo, Coda: A Morte de Michael Corleone\r\nКръстникът III\r\nLe parrain III\r\n教父3\r\nKum 3\r\nKmotr 3\r\nGodfather Part III\r\nAl-arraab 3\r\nAl abb Alrohy: Aljoz\' III\r\nRistiisa: III osa\r\nRistiisa 3\r\nKummisetä III\r\nKummisetä osa III\r\nKummisetä Osa III\r\nLe Parrain, 3ème partie\r\nLe Parrain, épilogue\r\nLe parrain, 3e partie\r\nDer Pate - Teil III\r\nMario Puzo\'s Der Pate - Teil III\r\nO nonos 3\r\nΟ νονός 3\r\nA keresztapa III.\r\nPedar khandeh 3\r\nIl padrino - Parte III\r\nIl Padrino Epilogo: La morte di Michael Corleone (1991)\r\nゴッドファーザーPARTIII\r\nゴッドファーザー最終章: マイケル・コルレオーネの最期\r\nKrikštatevis III\r\nEl padrino 3\r\nEl padrino, epílogo: La muerte de Michael Corleone\r\nGudfaren 3\r\nEl padrino III\r\nOjciec chrzestny III\r\nOjciec Chrzestny Mario Puzo, Epilog: Śmierć Michaela Corleone\r\nO Padrinho: Parte III\r\nNasul III\r\nКрестный отец: Часть III\r\nКум 3\r\nKrstný otec III\r\nBoter 3\r\nКрестный отец 3\r\nEl padrí III\r\nEl padrino: Parte III\r\nEl Padrino, epílogo: La muerte de Michael Corleone\r\nGudfadern del III\r\nBaba III\r\nХрещений батько 3\r\nХрещений батько III\r\nХрещений батько: Частина третя\r\nХрещений батько.

While he attempts to link the Corleone\'s finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster seeking to upset the existing Mafioso order and a young protege\'s love affair with his daughter.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nIt is 1979, about 22 years since the events of The Godfather II. For Michael Corleoune, the move to legitimacy is complete: the New York crime business has been handed over to Joey Zasa and all elements of the Corleone business empire are legal, non-criminal enterprises. Michael, approaching 60, is now thinking about his legacy. His charity, run by his daughter Mary, has just handed over $100 million to the Catholic Church. Michael also intends buying a large stake in International Immobiliari, a Vatican-run property company. Things are peaceful and stable but then Vincent Mancini, Sonny Corleone\'s illegitimate son, starts a feud with Joey Zasa. This has far-reaching, deadly consequences, including for Michael\'s deal with the Vatican.\r\n-\r\ngrantss','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 10:22:53','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOpOLmTm624','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',18),(7,'0109830','Forrest Gump','Forrest Gump','Forrest Gump\r\nForrest Qamp\r\nForrest Gump: O Contador de Histórias\r\nФорест Гъмп\r\n阿甘正传\r\nΦόρεστ Γκαμπ\r\nフォレスト・ガンプ　一期一会\r\nForestas Gampas\r\nФоррест Гамп\r\nФорест Гамп\r\n阿甘正傳\r\nAtchariya Panya Nim\r\nФоррест Ґамп\r\nForrest Gamp\r\nCuộc Đời Forrest Gump',1994,142,8.8,1960093,'English','United States','Drama\r\nRomance','Robert Zemeckis','Winston Groom\r\nEric Roth','Wendy Finerman\r\nCharles Newirth\r\nSteve Starkey\r\nSteve Tisch','Alan Silvestri','Tom Hanks\r\nRebecca Williams\r\nSally Field\r\nMichael Conner Humphreys\r\nHarold G.

He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His \'mama\' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.\r\n-\r\naliw135\r\n\r\nThe movie Forrest Gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. Gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. From wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average IQ and even being shot, Gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during Gump\'s life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. This skill allows Gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers\' lives and become famous for his ability. While Gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend Jenny Curran. The movie is centered on Forrest Gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of Jenny and how important she is to him. Although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. This upsets Gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other\'s lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the Reflection Pond in D.C. Even though Gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of Curran and the hardships she faces.\r\n-\r\nKathryn Logue\r\n\r\nSlow-witted Forrest Gump has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother, he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nForrest Gump, an innocent and kind-hearted Alabama boy, has been dealing with other people\'s unkindness nearly all his life. Having grown up with beautiful Jenny, his only friend, Forrest yearns to learn all about the ways of the world and embarks on a mission to find his true purpose in life. Thrust into downright extraordinary situations, Forrest finds himself present at some of the most pivotal events in the second half of the 20th century, rubbing shoulders with influential and historical figures, including John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, a nice young man from England named John Lennon, and even a handsome but still unknown Elvis Presley. Throughout his existence, Forrest has been encountering life\'s randomness; however, in this earth, no one is insignificant. With his presence alone, one builds his own place in this world, unknowingly changing the flow of things, while fate floats like a feather in the wind. But, in this life-altering journey, is Forrest meant to find his destiny, and be with Jenny?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 10:24:25','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRODefoJO_M','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::12\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::13\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::18+\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',12),(8,'0108052','Schindler\'s List','Schindler\'s List','Schindler\'s List\r\nLa lista de Schindler\r\nSchindlers Liste\r\nShindlerin Siyahisi\r\nСпіс Шындлера\r\nA Lista de Schindler\r\nСписъкът на Шиндлер\r\nLa liste de Schindler\r\n辛德勒的名单\r\nSchindlerova lista\r\nSchindlerův seznam\r\nSchindlers liste\r\nSchindleri nimekiri\r\nSchindlers lista\r\nSchindlerin lista\r\nSchindlerin Lista\r\nShindleris sia\r\nSteven Spielberg\'s Schindler\'s List\r\nI lista tou Schindler\r\nΗ λίστα του Σίντλερ\r\n舒特拉的名單\r\nSchindler listája\r\nSchindler Kee Soochee\r\nFehrest-e Schindler\r\nReshimut Schindler\r\nSchindler\'s List - La lista di Schindler\r\nShindorâ no risuto\r\nシンドラーのリスト\r\nŠindlerio sąrašas\r\nLista Schindlera\r\nШиндлеровата Листа\r\nLista lui Schindler\r\nСписок Шиндлера\r\nШиндлерова листа\r\nSchindlerov zoznam\r\nSchindlerjev seznam\r\nLa llista de Schindler\r\n辛德勒的名單\r\nChatakam Thi Lok Mai Luem\r\nSchindler\'in Listesi\r\nShindler ro\'yxati\r\nBản Danh Sách Của Schindler',1993,195,8.9,1297082,'English\r\nHebrew\r\nGerman\r\nPolish\r\nLatin','United States','Biography\r\nDrama\r\nHistory','Steven Spielberg','Thomas Keneally\r\nSteven Zaillian','Irving Glovin\r\nKathleen Kennedy\r\nBranko Lustig\r\nGerald R.

With no fuel readily available for the DeLorean, the two must figure how to escape the Old West before Emmett is murdered.\r\n\r\nStranded in 1955, Marty McFly receives written word from his friend, Doctor Emmett Brown, as to where can be found the DeLorean time machine. However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend\'s aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future.\r\n-\r\nVampire Sharpshooter\r\n\r\nThis movie picks up where the last one left off--Marty stuck in 1955 after watching the Delorean vanish after being struck by lightning with Doc in it. But moments after, he got a letter from Doc that tells him he was sent to 1885. But the Delorean was damaged and he can\'t repair it. So he placed it somewhere where he hopes Marty can find it in 1955 and hopefully his younger version can repair it so that Marty can return to 1985. So he goes to the 1955 Doc Brown and tells him about what happened and shows him the letter. So they set out to find the Delorean and do which was hidden near a cemetery. After finding the Delorean, Marty and Doc were about to leave when they find a tombstone with Doc\'s name on it that says he was killed a few days after he sent the letter and that he was killed by someone named Buford Tannen. Marty and Doc go to the library and learn that Tannen was a crazed gunman and a photo of Doc in 1885. Marty then decides to go back to 1885 to save Doc. Upon arriving, the Delorean gets damaged and the gas tank is leaking. Marty then goes to town to look for Doc. But along the way he meets Tannen and gets on his bad side. Doc saves him and Tannen threatens Doc. Marty then shows Doc the photo of his tombstone. That\'s when Marty and Doc get ready to leave. But when Marty tells him about the gas tank, Doc tells him, without gas they can\'t get the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour to activate the time circuits. So they scurry to find a way to get it up to that speed before Doc gets shot. They think they found one which they plan to implement on the day he gets shot. Doc then meets Clara Clayton, the town\'s new schoolteacher and is smitten with her. That\'s when he has second thoughts about leaving. When Tannen tries to make a move on Doc, Marty stops him that\'s when Tannen challenges Marty to a gunfight. Marty initially declines but when Tannen calls him a coward, Marty accepts. Doc and Marty\'s ancestor tries to convince him he\'s making a mistake.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the trilogy sends Marty McFly on a rescue mission to the year 1885, where he must save Doc Brown from death at the hands of yet another member of the Tannen clan. However, there are a number of complications preventing a quick return to the future: a lack of gasoline for the time-traveling DeLorean, a band of gunslinging outlaws and a schoolmarm with affections for the smitten Doc.\r\n-\r\nDavid Thiel\r\n\r\nStranded in 1955 after a freak burst of lightning, Marty must travel to 1885 to rescue Doc Brown from a premature end.

Dr. Emmett L. Brown and the time machine were somehow struck by lightning, and Marty somehow received a letter from Doc that he is okay, and in the year 1885. Marty and the 1955 Doc fix up the time machine after digging it up from a mine, then Marty discovers a gravestone with Doc\'s name on it, indicating that he will be killed by a man named Buford Tannen (Biff\'s great-grandfather). Marty makes an effort to travel to 1885 to save Doc from his bleak future. But Marty damages the time machine causing Marty and Doc to have to figure out how to get back to 1985.

Knowing that the country needs her husband to be able to communicate effectively, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) hires Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian actor and speech therapist, to help him overcome his stammer. An extraordinary friendship develops between the two men, as Logue uses unconventional means to teach the monarch how to speak with confidence.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nBiopic about Britain\'s King George VI (Colin Firth) (father of present day Queen Elizabeth II) and his lifelong struggle to overcome his speech impediment. Suffering from a stammer from the age of four or five, the young Prince Albert dreaded any public speaking engagement. History records that his speech at the closing of the 1925 Commonwealth exhibition in London was difficult for both him and everyone listening that day. He tried many different therapies over many years, but it was only when he met Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist, that he truly began to make progress. Logue did not have a medical degree, but had worked as an elocution coach in the theater and had worked with shell-shocked soldiers after World War I. Through a variety of techniques and much hard work, Albert learns to speak in such a way so as to make his impediment a minor problem and deliver a flawless speech heard around the world by radio when the U.K. declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939. The King and Logue remained life-long friends.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIn 1925, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) is a stammerer and has trouble speaking to the public. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks the treatment of speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) that follows unconventional methods and relationship, and Bertie gives up the treatment on the first day. However, after listening to the session that was recorded by Lionel, Bertie returns to the treatment. In the mid 1930s, the Duke of York is forced to assume the throne of the United Kingdom as King George VI, due to the abdication of his older brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). Immediately afterward, there is a crisis in the government and Britain declares war with Germany. King George VI needs to make a speech to his compatriots, and his friend Lionel helps him using an unorthodox technique.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 11:40:08','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcxBrTvLbBM','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::14+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::12',0),(11,'0133093','The Matrix','Matrix','The Matrix\r\nMatrix\r\nМатрицата\r\nLa matrice\r\n黑客帝国\r\nMaatriks\r\n22世紀殺人網絡\r\nMátrix\r\nFylkið\r\nMatorikkusu\r\nマトリックス\r\nMatrikss\r\nMatrica\r\nLa matriz\r\nМатрица\r\nМатрикс\r\n駭客任務\r\nPhôphan Manut Neūa Lôk 2199\r\nМатриця\r\nMatritsa\r\nMa Trận',1999,136,8.7,1833050,'English','United States\r\nAustralia','Action\r\nSci-Fi','Lana Wachowski\r\nLilly Wachowski','Lilly Wachowski\r\nLana Wachowski','Bruce Berman\r\nDan Cracchiolo\r\nCarol Hughes\r\nAndrew Mason\r\nRichard Mirisch\r\nBarrie M.

Batman\'s struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and improve his technology to stop him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes.\r\n-\r\nLeon Lombardi\r\n\r\nThe follow-up to Batman Begins (2005), this movie reunites Writer, Producer, and Director Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale, who reprises the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his continuing war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham for good. The triumvirate proves to be effective. But soon the three find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as \"The Joker\", who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.\r\n\r\nGotham\'s new District Attorney has been elected. His name is Harvey Dent, and he has a radical new agenda that threatens to take down Gotham\'s organized crime underworld once and for all with an iron fist. But the emergence of the rogue vigilante known as Batman has caused problems for Dent and his agenda. A new criminal mastermind known only as \"The Joker\" has arrived and aims to take Gotham out from under Harvey Dent\'s iron fist. The Joker stages a masterfully planned bank robbery and robs the Gotham mob blind. He uses this money to stage a series of horrific and strategic attacks against the city and its people, each one carefully planned and aimed at Dent and Batman, while causing the rest of the city to enter panic mode. Meanwhile, Batman thinks he might have found a lead to The Joker thanks to Wayne Enterprises\' dealings with a shady Chinese banker, and that takes Batman and Alfred to Hong Kong. The Joker has no rules, but Batman has only one, and the Joker aims to make Batman break his only rule. But who will be the one to take him out, will it be rogue vigilante Batman, or will it be elected official Harvey Dent, the new hero with a face?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nOne year after the events of Batman Begins (2008), Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and District Attorney Harvey Dent plan to launch an attack on the mob by arresting the shady accountant of the mob, Lau. Lau is abducted from his building by Batman and is thrown into jail. Lau divulges the secrets which results in almost all the mob bosses thrown in jail. The desperate mob bosses turn to The Joker, a sadistic psychopath with green hair, completely yellow teeth, and a custom purple suit. The Joker kills a judge, the Police Commissioner, and tries to kill the Mayor and Harvey. The acts of The Joker produces anarchy and chaos in the people of Gotham, forcing Batman to come to terms to which may seem to be his greatest test to fight injustice and come closer to the fine line between hero and vigilante.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nWith the help of allies Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City.

Thinking the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back and a miniature laser device in his hip. The laser reveals a Swiss bank account number. But our wet hero isn\'t dead, and soon finds himself in Zurich. In the bank vault the young man discovers his name, Jason Bourne. In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a huge pile of cash. In the U.S. Embassy, Jason Bourne discovers his love interest and travel partner, Marie, along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and mysterious martial arts skills, with Marie by his side, Bourne scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life... and finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots masterminded by the CIA.\r\n-\r\nJoshua Bess','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 04:38:35','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::14A\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::0\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16D',12),(20,'0120737','The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring','Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring','The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\r\nKryezoti i Unazave: Besëlidhja e Unazës\r\nEl señor de los anillos: La comunidad del anillo\r\nO Senhor dos Anéis: A Sociedade do Anel\r\nВластелинът на пръстените: Задругата на пръстена\r\nLe seigneur des anneaux - La communauté de l\'anneau\r\n指环王：护戒使者\r\nGospodar prstenova: Prstenova družina\r\nPán prstenů: Společenstvo prstenu\r\nRingenes herre: Eventyret om ringen\r\nSeyyed alkhavatem: Sohbat alkhatam\r\nSõrmuste isand: Sõrmuse vennaskond\r\nSagan om ringen: Härskarringen\r\nTaru sormusten herrasta: Sormuksen ritarit\r\nTaru Sormusten Herrasta - Sormuksen ritarit\r\nLe Seigneur des anneaux : La Communauté de l\'anneau\r\nBechdebis mbrdzanebeli: Bechdis sadzmo\r\nDer Herr der Ringe: Die Gefährten\r\nO arhontas ton dahtylidion: I syntrofia tou dahtylidiou\r\nΟ άρχοντας των δαχτυλιδιών: Η συντροφιά του δαχτυλιδιού\r\nA Gyűrűk Ura: A gyűrű szövetsége\r\nHringadróttinssaga: Föruneyti hringsins\r\nArbab-e halgheha: Yaran-e halgheh\r\nSar HaTabaot: Achvat HaTabaat\r\nIl Signore degli Anelli - La compagnia dell\'Anello\r\nLord of the Rings\r\nRôdo obu za ringu\r\nロード・オブ・ザ・リング\r\nGredzenu pavēlnieks: Gredzena brālība\r\nŽiedų valdovas.

When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it. However, he does not go alone. He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign.\r\n-\r\nPaul Twomey\r\n\r\nThe future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer, to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nThe power of Bilbo Baggins\' ring of invisibility may have been underestimated, Gandalf the Grey fears its power even with his unfathomable magical abilities. As the power of the one Ring grows, so too do the armies of Sauron and Sarumon as their evil spreads across the lands of man, dwarf, and elf alike. It is up to a ragtag band of heroes to carry the ring to Mount Doom, the evil place of its birth, and cast it into the eternal fires that forged it. Does the fellowship have what it takes to complete its task, or will the powers of evil overcome those of good leaving behind a world ravaged by the rage of Sauron, the Dark Lord?\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, still it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell, by chance, into the hands of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. On his eleventy-first birthday, Bilbo disappeared, bequeathing to his young nephew, Frodo, the Ruling Ring, and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.\r\n-\r\nThe Tolkien Society\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, the Elven-smiths created the Rings of Power. Then the Dark Lord Sauron created a Ring to rule the Lesser Rings. But the Ring was stolen, and for a long time, he thought it to be lost. But many years later, the Ring came to the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a land called the Shire, Frodo inherits the Ring from his uncle, Bilbo. Now Frodo must take a journey across Middle-earth, and throw the Ring into the volcano, Mt. Doom, the only place it can be destroyed.\r\n-\r\nnathan77','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 11:55:28','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TaYIYICv6s','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::PG\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',0),(21,'0167261','The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers','Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers','The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\r\nKryezoti i Unazave: Dy Kullat\r\nEl señor de los anillos: Las dos torres\r\nO Senhor dos Anéis: As Duas Torres\r\nВластелинът на пръстените: Двете кули\r\nLe Seigneur des anneaux: Les deux tours\r\n指环王：双塔奇兵\r\nGospodar prstenova: Dvije kule\r\nPán prstenů: Dvě věže\r\nRingenes herre: De to tårne\r\nSeyed alkhavatem 2\r\nSõrmuste isand: Kaks kantsi\r\nTaru sormusten herrasta: Kaksi tornia\r\nSagan om de två tornen\r\nLe Seigneur des anneaux : Les Deux Tours\r\nDer Herr der Ringe: Die zwei Türme\r\nO arhontas ton dahtylidion: Oi dyo pyrgoi\r\nΟ άρχοντας των δαχτυλιδιών: Οι δύο πύργοι\r\nA Gyűrűk Ura: A két torony\r\nHringadróttinssaga: Tveggja turna tal\r\nArbab-e halgheha 2: Do borj\r\nSar Hatabaot: Shnei Hatzri\'kh\'im\r\nIl Signore degli Anelli - Le due torri\r\nロード・オブ・ザ・リング 二つの塔\r\nGredzenu pavēlnieks: Divi torņi\r\nŽiedų valdovas.

The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dûr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman, under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue, have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White, who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him.

Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the One Ring, while Aragorn leads the forces of good against Sauron\'s evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nSauron\'s forces have laid siege to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, in their efforts to eliminate the race of men. The once-great kingdom, watched over by a fading Steward, has never been in more desperate need of its King. But can Aragorn answer the call of his heritage and become what he was born to be? In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his broad shoulders. With the final battle joined, and the legions of darkness gathering, Gandalf urgently tries to rally Gondor\'s broken army to action. He is aided by Rohan\'s King Theoden, who unites his warriors for history\'s biggest test. Yet even with their courage and passionate loyalty, the forces of men, with Eowyn and Merry hidden amongst them, are no match for the enemies swarming against Gondor. Still, in the face of great losses, they charge forward into the battle of their lifetimes, tied together by their singular goal to keep Sauron distracted and give the Ring Bearer a chance to complete his quest. Their hopes rest with Frodo, a tiny but determined Hobbit making a perilous trip across treacherous enemy lands to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. The closer Frodo gets to his destination, the heavier his burden becomes, and the more he must rely on Samwise Gamgee. Gollum, and the Ring, will test Frodo\'s allegiances and, ultimately, his humanity.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nGondor is overrun by the orcs of Mordor, and Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith to aid the humans in the war that is ahead. Aragorn must realize his true identity and purpose as the King of Men, and journey with Gimli and Legolas to summon the Army of the Dead so that the battle against evil can be won. Meanwhile, paranoia and suspicion rises between Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they continue their increasingly dark and dangerous travel to Mount Doom, the one place where the One Ring can be destroyed once and for all.\r\n-\r\nQrrbirbel\r\n\r\nThe Fellowship divides to conquer as Frodo and Sam, with the help and hindrance of Gollum, continue their way to Mount Doom. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to help defend Gondor while Merry remains with Éowyn and the other Rohan fighters. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek aid from those that live in the Cursed Mountains. All of these battles have one goal in mind: distract the Eye of Sauron and buy Frodo a little more time to destroy the One Ring.\r\n-\r\nPompeyV\r\n\r\nThe War of the Ring reaches its climax as the Dark Lord Sauron sets his sights on Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. The members of the Fellowship in Rohan are warned of the impending attack when Pippin cannot resist looking into Saruman\'s palantír and is briefly contacted by the Dark Lord. King Théoden is too proud to send his men to help without being asked, so Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to see that this request is sent. They meet opposition there from Denethor, Steward of the city and father of Faramir and the late Boromir. Denethor\'s family has acted as temporary guardians of Gondor for centuries until a member of the true line of Kings returns. This member is none other than Aragorn, who must overcome his own self-doubt before he can take on the role he was destined to fulfill. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to carry the One Ring towards Mordor, guided by Gollum. What they don\'t know is that Gollum is leading them into a trap so that he can reclaim the Ring for himself. Though Sam suspects his deceit, Frodo is starting to be corrupted by the Ring\'s power and the mistrust of Sam this causes is fully exploited by Gollum. The only way good can prevail in this contest is if the Ring is destroyed, an event that is becoming harder every minute for Frodo to achieve. The fate of every living creature in Middle-earth will be decided once and for all as the Quest of the Ringbearer reaches its climax.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 11:59:36','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4QWnXRUd3k','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::A\r\nIreland::12\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::12',12),(23,'0172495','Gladiator','Gladiator','Gladiator\r\nGladiador\r\nГладиатор\r\nGladiateur\r\n角斗士\r\nGladijator\r\nGladiátor\r\nGladiaator\r\nGladiaattori\r\nGladiator - Special Edition\r\nMonomahos\r\nΜονομάχος\r\nSkylmingaþrællinn\r\nVijeta\r\nग्लेडिएटर\r\nIl gladiatore\r\nグラディエーター\r\nGladiatorius\r\nGladiatoren\r\nGladiatorul\r\nГладијатор\r\nGladiator (El gladiador)\r\n神鬼戰士\r\nNakrop Phu Kla Pha Phaendin Thorarat\r\nGladyatör\r\nГладіатор\r\nThe Gladiators\r\nVõ Sĩ Giác Đấu',2000,155,8.5,1432959,'English','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nMalta\r\nMorocco','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nDrama','Ridley Scott','David Franzoni\r\nDavid Franzoni\r\nJohn Logan\r\nWilliam Nicholson','David Franzoni\r\nBranko Lustig\r\nLaurie MacDonald\r\nTerry Needham\r\nWalter F.

Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.\r\n-\r\nChris \"Morphy\" Terry\r\n\r\nCommodus takes power and strips rank from Maximus, one of the favored generals of his predecessor and father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the great stoical philosopher.

Rome, the weary and dying emperor, Marcus Aurelius, names his loyal and triumphant general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, his successor and protector of Rome, much to the dismay of his haughty and unbalanced son, Commodus. But, instead, death and entrapment await, as the embittered and blind with rage rival rewards Rome\'s hero with an order for his execution, only to wind up as a slave to the former gladiator, Proximo. From the vast deserts of North Africa, a new Maximo will rise as a gladiator, hacking and slashing his way through all the way up to Mother Rome and the unsuspecting dictator, Commodus. But will the popular general ever find peace in a long-awaited retribution?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn Gladiator, victorious general Maximus Decimus Meridias has been named keeper of Rome and its empire by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius, so that rule might pass from the Caesars back to the people and Senate. Marcus\' neglected and power-hungry son, Commodus, has other ideas, however. Escaping an ordered execution, Maximus hurries back to his home in Spain, too late to save his wife and son from the same order. Taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator by Proximo, Maximus lives only that he might someday take his revenge and fulfill the dying wish of his emperor. The time soon comes when Proximo\'s troupe is called to Rome to participate in a marathon of gladiator games held at the behest of the new emperor, Commodus. Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla, Commodus\' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nA dying Marcus Aurelius plans to name his loyal and brave General Maximus as his successor in order to restore the power of the Roman Senate. However, his power-hungry, jealous son Commodus learns of the plan, murders Marcus Aurelius, and plans to execute Maximus in order to secure his claim to the throne. Maximus escapes execution, but is sold into slavery and is forced to become a gladiator. Eventually, Maximus and his fellow gladiators are sent to Rome to perform for Commodus. Through his bravery he wins over the masses and reveals his true identity, much to the chagrin of Commodus. Can Maximus use his newfound popularity to avenge Marcus Aurelius\' death, or will Commodus be able to keep the throne?\r\n-','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 12:00:43','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhntiTnwcGs','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::Unrated\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',12),(24,'0119217','Good Will Hunting','Good Will Hunting','Good Will Hunting\r\nEn busca del destino\r\nGênio Indomável\r\nДобрият Уил Хънтинг\r\nLe destin de Will Hunting\r\nEn Busca del Destino\r\n心灵捕手\r\nDobri Will Hunting\r\nDobrý Will Hunting\r\nHea Will Hunting\r\nWill Hunting\r\nWill Hunting - syntynyt neroksi\r\nGood Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting\r\nO xehoristos Will Hunting\r\nΟ ξεχωριστός Γουίλ Χάντινγκ\r\n驕陽似我\r\nWill Hunting-e khoob\r\nSippuro Shel Will Hunting\r\nWill Hunting - Genio ribelle\r\nグッド・ウィル・ハンティング　旅立ち\r\nGerasis Vilas Hantingas\r\nMente indomable\r\nDen enestående Will Hunting\r\nBuntownik z wyboru\r\nO Bom Rebelde\r\nУмница Уилл Хантинг\r\nДобри Вил Хантинг\r\nEl indomable Will Hunting\r\n心靈捕手\r\nCan Dostum\r\nРозумник Вілл Хантінг\r\nZakovatli Uill Xanting',1997,126,8.3,923145,'English','United States','Drama\r\nRomance','Gus Van Sant','Matt Damon\r\nBen Affleck','Su Armstrong\r\nLawrence Bender\r\nJonathan Gordon\r\nChris Moore\r\nScott Mosier\r\nKevin Smith\r\nBob Weinstein\r\nHarvey Weinstein','Danny Elfman','Matt Damon\r\nBen Affleck\r\nStellan Skarsgård\r\nJohn Mighton\r\nRachel Majorowski\r\nColleen McCauley\r\nCasey Affleck\r\nCole Hauser\r\nMatt Mercier\r\nRalph St. George\r\nRob Lynds\r\nDan Washington\r\nAlison Folland\r\nDerrick Bridgeman\r\nVik Sahay\r\nShannon Egleson\r\nRob Lyons\r\nSteven Kozlowski\r\nMinnie Driver\r\nJennifer Deathe\r\nScott William Winters\r\nPhilip Williams\r\nPatrick O\'Donnell\r\nKevin Rushton\r\nJimmy Flynn\r\nJoe Cannon\r\nAnn Matacunas\r\nGeorge Plimpton\r\nFrancesco Clemente\r\nRobin Williams\r\nJessica Morton\r\nBarna Moricz\r\nLibby Geller\r\nChas Lawther\r\nRichard Fitzpatrick\r\nFrank Nakashima\r\nChris Britton\r\nDavid Eisner\r\nBruce Hunter\r\nRobert Talvano\r\nJames Allodi\r\nMichael Arthur\r\nSteve Bertorelli\r\nNancy Carlsson-Paige\r\nKent Damon\r\nPaul Essiembre\r\nJed Griswold\r\nChristian Harmony\r\nRobert Harrell\r\nElisabeth Anne Hughes\r\nHarmony Korine\r\nRiva Lombardi\r\nThomas Lundy\r\nPaul McGillicuddy\r\nMichael A.

When he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another fake attendee of support groups, his life seems to become a little more bearable. However when he associates himself with Tyler (Brad Pitt) he is dragged into an underground fight club and soap making scheme. Together the two men spiral out of control and engage in competitive rivalry for love and power.\r\n-\r\nRhiannon\r\n\r\nA young man leads a pretty humdrum life assessing car crashes to determine if his automobile company should issue recalls to fix problems. He also suffers from insomnia and takes to attending group therapy sessions for people who have survived various diseases. There he meets Marla who like him attends these sessions though she is neither a victim nor a survivor. His life changes when he meets Tyler Durden on a flight home. Tyler seems to be everything that he\'s not and together they create a men-only group for bare-knuckle fighting. It soon becomes all the rage with fight clubs springing up across the country and the group itself becoming an anti-capitalist domestic terrorist organization. Tyler and Marla develop a relationship leaving him often on the outside of what is going on. He soon finds that the group is out of control and after a major self-revelation decides there is only one way out.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nAn insomniac unnamed narrator needs a fantasy to escape from his deadly boring life, he tries joining a cancer support group however the only thing they do in the group is cry into each others chest, but then he is on a plane on his way back from what a viewer would assume is a business trip our unnamed narrator encounters Tyler Durden, a soap selling bad-ass who happens to run a secret fight club in the diner parking lot with his friend who follows 8 simple rules set out by Tyler, our unnamed narrator of course is taken into this scheme ran by Tyler.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nPosing as a pitiful sufferer during fruitless late-night sessions in highly addictive support groups for terminal illnesses, an unhappy insomniac struggles to find meaning in his mundane and dysfunctional existence. Then, a fateful encounter with the anarchist philosopher and travelling soap salesman, Tyler Durden, changes his life, as--for the first time in a long while--the bored white-collar worker reconnects with his inner self. Much to his surprise, the formerly depressed loner finds himself deriving pleasure out of pain through bare-knuckle brawls in the Fight Club: an underground society of men who yearn to free themselves from the fetters of a cruel modern life. Now, he is ready to wage war. Are violence and freedom the two sides of the same coin?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nA young urban professional who works for a major car manufacturer can\'t sleep. Although he doesn\'t have any of the associated afflictions, he stumbles across support groups as a means to let out whatever emotions he is feeling, which in turn allows him to sleep. But the use of these support groups is ruined when he meets a young woman named Marla Singer, who is also going to all these support group meetings. Because he knows she too is not afflicted with any of the maladies for which the groups exist, her presence has lessened the impact of the stories he hears. His life changes when he meets a soap manufacturer named Tyler Durden, who in many ways is the antithesis of the insomniac. Due to unusual circumstances with his own condo, the insomniac moves in with Tyler, who lives in a large dilapidated house in an otherwise abandoned part of town. After a bit of spontaneous roughhousing with Tyler in a bar parking lot, the insomniac finds it becomes a ritual between the two of them, which helps him cope with the other more difficult aspects of his life. The fights also attract a following, others who not only want to watch but join in. Understanding that there are other men like them, the insomniac and Tyler begin a secret fight club. As the fight club\'s popularity grows, so does its scope in all aspects. Marla becomes a circle not specifically of the fight clubs but of Tyler and the insomniac\'s collectives lives. As the nature of the fight clubs becomes out of control in the insomniac\'s view, the insomniac\'s life, in association, is one where he no longer understands what is happening around him, or how he can get out of it without harming himself.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 12:04:09','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7cl6-8E1gA','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::R18+\r\nBelgium::KNT/ENA\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::18A\r\nChile::18\r\nColombia::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::18\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM18\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/18\r\nRomania::I.M.-18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R18\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::18\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(26,'0382625','The Da Vinci Code','Da Vinci Code','The Da Vinci Code\r\nEl código Da Vinci\r\nThe Da Vinci Code - Sakrileg\r\nDa Vinchi Shifresi\r\nO Código Da Vinci\r\nШифърът на Леонардо\r\nLe code Da Vinci\r\nDa Vinci Code\r\nDa Vincijev kod\r\nŠifra mistra Leonarda\r\nDa Vinciho kód\r\nDa Vinci mysteriet\r\nDa Vinci kood\r\nDa Vinci-koden\r\nDa Vinci -koodi\r\nDa Vinchis Kodi\r\nKodikas Da Vinci\r\nΚώδικας Da Vinci\r\nA Da Vinci-kód\r\nTzofen Da Vinci\r\nIl codice da Vinci\r\nダ・ヴィンチ・コード\r\nDa Vinči kods\r\nDa Vinčio kodas\r\nKod da Vinci\r\nCodul lui Da Vinci\r\nКод да Винчи\r\nДа Винчијев код\r\nDa Vincijeva šifra\r\n達文西密碼\r\nDa Vinci şifresi\r\nКод да Вінчі\r\nMật Mã Da Vinci\r\nThe DaVinci Code',2006,149,6.6,421486,'English\r\nFrench\r\nLatin\r\nSpanish','United States\r\nMalta\r\nFrance\r\nUnited Kingdom','Mystery\r\nThriller','Ron Howard','Akiva Goldsman\r\nDan Brown','Dan Brown\r\nJohn Calley\r\nBrian Grazer\r\nTodd Hallowell\r\nRon Howard\r\nKathleen McGill\r\nLouisa Velis','Hans Zimmer','Tom Hanks\r\nAudrey Tautou\r\nIan McKellen\r\nJean Reno\r\nPaul Bettany\r\nAlfred Molina\r\nJürgen Prochnow\r\nJean-Yves Berteloot\r\nEtienne Chicot\r\nJean-Pierre Marielle\r\nMarie-Françoise Audollent\r\nRita Davies\r\nFrancesco Carnelutti\r\nSeth Gabel\r\nShane Zaza\r\nAndy Clark\r\nFausto Maria Sciarappa\r\nJoe Grossi\r\nDenis Podalydès\r\nHarry Taylor\r\nClive Carter\r\nGarance Mazureck\r\nDaisy Doidge-Hill\r\nLilli Ella Kelleher\r\nCrisian Emanuel\r\nCharlotte Graham\r\nXavier de Guillebon\r\nTonio Descanvelle\r\nDavid Bark-Jones\r\nSeretta Wilson\r\nEglantine Rembauville-Nicolle\r\nDan Tondowski\r\nAewia Huillet\r\nRoland John-Leopoldie\r\nDavid Saracino\r\nLionel Guy-Bremond\r\nYves Aubert\r\nRachael Black\r\nDez Drummond\r\nMark Roper\r\nBrock Little\r\nMatthew Butler-Hart\r\nRoland Menou\r\nHugh Mitchell\r\nTina Maskell\r\nPeter Pedrero\r\nSam Mancuso\r\nAndre Lillis\r\nMario Vernazza\r\nAgathe Natanson\r\nDaz Parker\r\nAndy Robb\r\nTom Barker\r\nMaggie McEwan\r\nMichael Bertenshaw\r\nSarah Wildor\r\nDavid Bertrand\r\nPaul Adams\r\nLasco Atkins\r\nDidier Dell Benjamin\r\nStefana Brancastle\r\nLiliane Briand\r\nDamian Brooke\r\nDan Brown\r\nSteven J.

The stately silence of Paris\' Louvre museum is broken when one of the gallery\'s leading curators is found dead on the grounds, with strange symbols carved into his body and left around the spot where he died. Hoping to learn the significance of the symbols, police bring in Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a gifted cryptographer who is also the victim\'s granddaughter. Needing help, Sophie calls on Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a leading symbologist from the United States. As Sophie and Robert dig deeper into the case, they discover the victim\'s involvement in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members have been privy to forbidden knowledge dating back to the birth of Christianity. In their search, Sophie and Robert happen upon evidence that could lead to the final resting place of the Holy Grail, while members of the priory and an underground Catholic society known as Opus Dei give chase, determined to prevent them from sharing their greatest secrets with the world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Robert Langdon is in Paris on business when he\'s summoned to The Louvre. A dead body has been found, setting Langdon off on an adventure as he attempts to unravel an ancient code and uncover the greatest mystery of all time.\r\n-\r\ncomicfan\r\n\r\nThe story tells the investigation started by symbolist Robert Langdon and a good-looking cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, around the murder of a Museum Louvre\'s curator. In fact, the unfortunate murdered man was Sophie\'s grandfather, and the corpse was found with a series of symbols and codes, like a pentagram and a Fibonacci number sequence. But police detective Fache will begin to chase Langdon, who escapes after receiving a warning about the captain\'s real intentions. Sophie has with her a kind of key with dots and number 24 engraved on it, which opens to her and Langdon a big complex investigation that involves a supposedly heretic theory: Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were, in fact, a couple who produced a daughter named Sara. A millenarian sect called The Priory of Sion has kept for centuries the secret of that matter. A masochist and kind of psychopath albino monk, Sibilas, an Opus Dei member, will chase Langdon and Sophie as well, in order to impede that they solve the mystery of Christ and Mary Magdalene, and also the real meaning and location of the Holy Grail. A passionate British researcher, will help Langdon in his quest, revealing to them several symbolisms in Da Vinci\'s master work The Last Supper, traveling to mythical places in the U.K., such as The Church Temple, where it is believed that a group of Templars Knights are buried, and Sir Isaac Newton\'s tomb at Westminster Abbey, where are located some of the main keys to solve the Holy Grail\'s mystery.\r\n-\r\nAlejandro Frias\r\n\r\nWhen respected American religious symbology expert Dr. Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre by the French version of the F.B.I., led by Captain Bezu Fache, he soon discovered that he is the number one suspect for the murder of a historian Langdon had been scheduled to meet. Assisted by a French cryptographer and government agent named Sophie, Langdon is challenged to decipher a chain of cryptic codes and puzzles, all the while trying to stay ahead of Fache\'s lawmen in a chase through the Louvre, and out into the Parisian cityscape, and finally across the channel to England. Can Langdon and Sophie decipher the nature of a secret dating back to Leonardo Da Vinci and earlier before those responsible for the historian\'s murder add them to their hit list?\r\n-\r\nAustin4577@aol.com\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is informed that the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. Solving the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is seemingly stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, clues visible for all to see, and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu who learns that the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion, an actual secret society. In a breathless race through Paris, London and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless power broker who appears to work for Opus Dei, a clandestine, Vatican-sanctioned Catholic organization believed to have long plotted to seize the Priory\'s secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory\'s secret, and a stunning historical truth, will be lost forever.\r\n-\r\nbondish','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 12:05:39','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2whAEEZ8OQ','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEgypt::(Banned)\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::14\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nLebanon::(Banned)\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVenezuela::PG-13',18),(27,'0808151','Angels & Demons','Angels & Demons','Angels & Demons\r\nÁngeles y demonios\r\nIlluminati\r\nAnjos e Demônios\r\nАнгели и демони\r\nAnges et démons\r\nÁngeles y Demonios\r\n天使与魔鬼\r\nAnđeli i demoni\r\nAndělé a démoni\r\nEngle & dæmoner\r\nInglid ja deemonid\r\nEnkelit ja demonit\r\nÄnglar och demoner\r\nAnges et Démons\r\nAnges & Démons\r\nIlluminati - Oi pefotismenoi\r\nΙlluminati: Οι πεφωτισμένοι\r\n天使與魔鬼\r\nAngyalok és démonok\r\nFereshtegan va Shayateen\r\nMal\'achim Veshedim\r\nAngeli e demoni\r\nTenshi to akuma\r\n天使と悪魔\r\nEņģeļi un dēmoni\r\nAngelai ir Demonai\r\nAngels & demons - Het bernini mysterie\r\nEngler & Demoner\r\nEngler og Demoner\r\nAnioły i demony\r\nAnjos e Demónios\r\nIngeri & demoni\r\nАнгелы и демоны\r\nАнђели и демони\r\nAnjeli a démoni\r\nMelekler ve şeytanlar\r\nЯнголи та Демони\r\nAngels and Demons\r\nObelisk\r\nAngeles y Demonios\r\nThiên Thần & Ác Quỷ',2009,138,6.7,286613,'English\r\nItalian\r\nLatin\r\nFrench\r\nSwiss German\r\nGerman\r\nChinese\r\nSpanish\r\nPolish','United States\r\nItaly','Action\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Ron Howard','David Koepp\r\nAkiva Goldsman\r\nDan Brown','Dan Brown\r\nJohn Calley\r\nWilliam M.

Robert and Vittoria also are searching for a new very destructive weapon that could kill millions.\r\n-\r\nXXDustfingerXX\r\n\r\nDespite his notorious relationship with the Roman Catholic church, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is once again called upon to decipher the clues to a catastrophic conspiracy. The Pope has died, and before a conclave can begin to determine his successor, the four preferitti (primary hopefuls for the papacy) are kidnapped. An ominous threat of their hourly demise, along with the complete annihilation of Vatican City, is issued as an elaborate revenge scheme by a persecuted group known as the Illuminati. With their meager time limit steadily counting down, Langdon, accompanied by beautiful physicist Vittoria Vetra, must travel throughout Rome to unravel the carefully hidden signs that will lead them to a terrifying adversary, a harrowing discovery, and the shocking truth.\r\n-\r\nThe Massie Twins\r\n\r\nThe Pope has died and the conclave has been called. Four candidates have been chosen. However, before the voting, the four candidates are killed one by one. The killer leaves clues that seem to say that he or she is a member of the Illuminati. Strangely though, the Illuminati was long thought to be eradicated. Who is the mastermind? Who revived the Illuminati? What do they want?\r\n-\r\nRyanking\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Pope, the conclave has gathered in a locked room to choose his successor among four cardinals designated \"preferitti\". However the quartet is abducted by the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood that was supposed eradicated. The symbologist Robert Langdon and the scientist Vittoria Vetra, who had her powerful and dangerous prototype of antimatter research stolen, are invited by the Vatican police to help them in their investigations. They are received by the receptive Camerlengo, Patrick McKenna, and by the reluctant Commander Richter. They are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then blow up Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-04-08','','2020-04-08 12:06:57','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ymOPuUJkvY','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::G\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::14\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',12),(110,'2304933','The 5th Wave','5th Wave','The 5th Wave\r\nLa quinta ola\r\nA 5ª Onda\r\nПетата вълна\r\nLa 5e Vague\r\nLa Cinquième Vague\r\nPátá vlna\r\nDen 5. bølge\r\n5. aalto\r\nDie 5.

Young undercover cop Billy Costigan is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello. While Billy quickly gains Costello\'s confidence, Colin Sullivan, a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the state police as an informer for the syndicate is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by their double lives, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations they have penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there is a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy - and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save themselves.

Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) is a Massachusetts State police detective. He has risen through the ranks to head up a special department. Public Enemy Number 1 is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a crime network kingpin, and Sullivan\'s main target. However, Sullivan is a paid informant for Costello, giving him tip-offs on police raids and other useful information. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) works for Costello. However, he is actually an undercover policeman, spying on Costello. In due course, both know that there is a rat in their organization, but don\'t know their identity. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues, with both trying to uncover the other without being discovered themselves.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nThe young police officer, Billy Costigan, risks his morals and sanity to infiltrate the American-Irish gang of the local mob boss, Frank Costello. As Billy gains Costello\'s trust, the Massachusetts State police detective, Colin Sullivan, becomes Costello\'s paid informant. And more and more, each man immerses himself deeply in his double life, gathering information about each side\'s plans and operations. But, when it becomes clear that there is a mole in their midst, suddenly, both impostors realise that this volatile situation could blow their cover, setting in motion a frenzied race against time to expose the other\'s identity to save their skin.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nYears ago, a powerful Irish mafia figure placed a small selection of his youngest, brightest men into the Massachusetts State Police Academy as cadets. Their purpose is to eventually rise within the prestigious ranks of the state police department, to serve as the eyes and ears of their boss. While somewhere else, a young cadet was assigned with an equally dangerous task: infiltrate the Irish syndicate headed by the man sending in his own to the Massachusetts State Police. Now, one cadet is an up and coming police official with a torn allegiance to his job and to the criminal mastermind that put him there. While the other cadet is the trusted number two of that man, only finding his professional duties are becoming blurred with his current state. But new clues have lead to unfortunate discoveries, when both sides realize they\'re being watched by the enemy.\r\n-\r\nmystic80','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 04:37:43','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIran::18+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRomania::I.C.-14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(28,'0368891','National Treasure','National Treasure','National Treasure\r\nLa leyenda del tesoro perdido\r\nDas Vermächtnis der Tempelritter\r\nA Lenda do Tesouro Perdido\r\nСъкровището\r\nTrésor national\r\nLa Leyenda del Tesoro Perdido\r\nNacionalno blago\r\nLovci pokladů\r\nRahvuslik aare\r\nNational Treasure - Kansallisaarre\r\nKansallisaarre\r\nBenjamin Gates et le Trésor des Templiers\r\nSta ihni tou hamenou thisavrou\r\nΣτα ίχνη του χαμένου θησαυρού\r\nA nemzet aranya\r\nIl mistero dei Templari\r\nナショナル・トレジャー\r\nNacionālie dārgumi\r\nKodas: Lobiai\r\nSonomo\r\nSkarb narodów\r\nO Tesouro\r\nComoara nationala\r\nСокровище нации\r\nLovci pokladov: Honba za pokladom Templárov\r\nZaklad pozabljenih\r\nLa búsqueda (National Treasure)\r\nLa búsqueda\r\n國家寶藏\r\nBüyük hazine\r\nСкарб нації\r\nKho Báu Quôc Gia',2004,131,6.9,321225,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Jon Turteltaub','Jim Kouf\r\nCormac Wibberley\r\nMarianne Wibberley\r\nJim Kouf\r\nOren Aviv\r\nCharles Segars','Oren Aviv\r\nJerry Bruckheimer\r\nBenjamin Melniker\r\nChad Oman\r\nPat Sandston\r\nCharles Segars\r\nChristina Steinberg\r\nMike Stenson\r\nJon Turteltaub\r\nMichael E.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly\'s photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nFlying from one country to another, troubleshooting problems and arranging package transfers all over the world, the driven but overworked and time-obsessed Federal Express executive, Chuck Noland, is living a hectic life. In 1995, against the backdrop of the impending New Year\'s Eve, an unforeseen complication forces Noland to leave his sad but understanding girlfriend, Kelly, behind, and catch a plane to Malaysia, only to end up marooned on an uncharted, uninhabited island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly, for the first time in a long while, Chuck has all the time in the world; however, bereft of the comforts of civilisation, tending to his fundamental needs now becomes a constant struggle. Now, Chuck, the only living soul on the islet, must summon up the strength to survive. But, can he resist despair, and maintain hope to stay alive?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nAfter FedEx systems engineer Chuck Noland is ripped out of his hasty life by the clock in a plane crash, he finds himself alone on the shores of a tropical island. First, frustration gets to him and then he realizes how little his chances are to ever get back to civilization. Four years later, Chuck has learned very well how to survive on his own: mending his dental health, catching fish with a spear, predicting the weather with a self-made calendar. A photograph of his girlfriend Kelly has kept his hopes alive all these years. Finally, Chuck takes the opportunity to take off for home: he sets off on a wooden raft with a sail that has washed ashore.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl\r\n\r\nChuck Noland is a FedEx manager who demands that everything must be on time and travels the world to make sure punctuality is on top of everything else. He has a girlfriend, Kelly, with whom he is deeply in love with and family he hardly sees. When work intrudes on Christmas Eve, Chuck has a quick gift exchange in the car and kisses Kelly goodbye. He boards a delivery plane going overseas which gets caught in a horrendous storm and crashes into the Pacific. The sole survivor Chuck washes up on a remote island along with several FedEx packages that he must use for supplies. With limited luxury, he adapts to the island over the course of 1,500 nights. When Chuck finally sees his chance he rafts out on the ocean and fortunately is spotted. After a bittersweet welcome-back reception, Chuck finds Kelly has married another man and has children. But he is missing more than her. For all his life his objective was work. For four years, it was survival. Now Chuck is compelled to live.\r\n-\r\nDonnel Hoffman\r\n\r\nChuck, a top international manager for FedEx, and Kelly, a Ph.D. student, are in love and heading towards marriage. Then Chuck\'s plane to Malaysia ditches at sea during a terrible storm. He\'s the only survivor, and he washes up on a tiny island with nothing but some flotsam and jetsam from the aircraft\'s cargo. Can he survive in this tropical wasteland? Will he ever return to woman he loves?\r\n-\r\nMartin Lewison','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-08 12:24:23','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHRbnONjCU','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(30,'0338751','The Aviator','Aviator','The Aviator\r\nEl aviador\r\nAviator\r\nO Aviador\r\nАвиаторът\r\nL\'aviateur\r\nAvijatičar\r\nLetec\r\nAviaator - valguses ja varjus\r\nLentäjä\r\nFlygaren\r\nIptamenos kroisos\r\nΙπτάμενος Κροίσος\r\nAviátor\r\nHavanavard\r\nアビエイター\r\nAviators\r\nAviatorius\r\nAviatorul\r\nАвиатор\r\nАвијатичар\r\nLetalec\r\n神鬼玩家\r\nBin Rak Banleu Lôk\r\nGöklerin hâkimi\r\nАвіатор\r\nPhi Công Tỷ Phú',2004,170,7.5,351943,'English','United States\r\nGermany','Biography\r\nDrama','Martin Scorsese','John Logan','Chris Brigham\r\nSanford R.

Pictures, but mostly focusing on his role in designing and promoting new aircraft. Hughes was a risk-taker spending several fortunes on designing experimental aircraft and eventually founding TWA as a rival to Pan Am airlines owned by his great rival Juan Trippe. When Trippe\'s politico Senator Ralph Owen Brewster accuses Hughes of being a war profiteer, it\'s Hughes who gains the upper hand. Hughes also had many women in his life including a long relationship with Katharine Hepburn. From an early age, however, Hughes was also germophobic and would have severe bouts of mental illness.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nBillionaire and aviation tycoon Howard Hughes is a successful public figure: a director of big-budget Hollywood movies such as \"Hell\'s Angels (1930)\", a passionate lover of Hollywood\'s leading ladies Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner, and an aviation pioneer who helps build TWA into a major airline. But in private, Hughes remains tormented, suffering from paralyzing phobias and depression. The higher he rises, the farther has to fall.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nTexan oil fortune heir Howard Hughes refuses to wisely invest and enjoy his millions, preferring to riskily spend on his passions: airplanes and Hollywood, so in the 1930s he produces an unprecedented air combat blockbuster Hell Angels which he keeps improving to staff\'s despair, with Katherine Hepburn as bonus lover. He moves on to improving airplane design and running airline TWA, the sole US-overseas challenger for PanAm. His germophobia gets utterly out of hand and test-piloting himself nearly breaks every bone is his body, but the worst challenge comes from senator Ralph Owen Brewster, who uses the FBI to threaten Hughes with ruin and public exposure as \'war profiteer\' unless he accepts personal friend Juan Trippe\'s company PanAm being given a virtual monopoly on international flights.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nSpanning nearly two decades in the life of billionaire entrepreneur, aeronautics visionary, bold Hollywood producer, and fearless pilot, Howard Hughes, Martin Scorsese\'s \"Aviator\" opens with the independent-minded tycoon investing large sums of money in Hell\'s Angels (1930), the most expensive silent film ever. Eccentric, charismatic, but also a chronic sufferer from obsessive-compulsive disorder, Howard Hughes became notorious for his romantic affairs with Hollywood\'s iconic actresses, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Ginger Rogers, and Jean Harlow. As an intrepid aviator, Howard Hughes broke every flying record, created TWA, had a near-death experience while test-piloting the XF-11 military reconnaissance aircraft, and locked horns with Maine Senator, Owen Brewster, and Pan Am in a legal battle over exclusivity on international air travel. But, in the quest to build an aviation empire, Hughes\' inner demons and his aggressive phobias threatened to put in jeopardy not only his sanity but also his entire fortune, risking to lose everything and go down in flames.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nPhenomenal public success contrasts with private behaviors close to madness: Howard Hughes from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, from \"Hell\'s Angels (1930)\" (spending a fortune on details) through the only flight of the Hercules, a huge, money-losing transport plane. Along the way, the public Hughes sees the big picture, in movies and in aviation, building TWA and leading it through a fight with Pan Am and the U.S. Senate. In private, phobias and compulsions threaten him with self-imposed solitary confinement. How long can his imagination, drive, and the sympathies of Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and the men who work for him stave off these internal disorders?\r\n-','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-08 12:25:24','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-xGf2Fs-0','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12',12),(31,'0110912','Pulp Fiction','Pulp Fiction','Pulp Fiction\r\nTiempos violentos\r\nKriminal Qirayet\r\nPulp Fiction: Tempo de Violência\r\nКриминале\r\nFiction pulpeuse\r\nPulp Fiction: Tiempos violentos\r\n低俗小说\r\nPakleni šund\r\nPulp Fiction: Historky z podsvětí\r\nبالب فيكشن\r\nPulp Fiction: Tarinoita väkivallasta\r\nTarinoita väkivallasta\r\nMakulatura\r\n危險人物\r\nPonyvaregény\r\nपल्प फिक्शन\r\nPulp fiction\r\nDastan-e aame pasand\r\nSifrut Zolla\r\nパルプ・フィクション\r\nLubene\r\nBulvarinis skaitalas\r\nКриминальное чтиво\r\nПетпарачке приче\r\nPulp Fiction: Historky z podsvetia\r\nŠund\r\n黑色追緝令\r\nKhayao Chipphachon Koen Dueat\r\nUcuz Roman\r\nКримінальне чтиво\r\nBlack Mask\r\nJinoiy cho\'pchak',1994,154,8.9,1954768,'English\r\nSpanish\r\nFrench','United States','Crime\r\nDrama','Quentin Tarantino','Quentin Tarantino\r\nRoger Avary\r\nQuentin Tarantino','Lawrence Bender\r\nDanny DeVito\r\nRichard N.

Entrusted with retrieving a glow-emitting leather suitcase which belongs to their boss--the powerful crime kingpin, Marsellus--instead, the dark-suited gunmen, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, end up with a bloody mess. Fortunately--with men like Mr Wolf always around to handle a crisis--there\'s time to cool off in a long twist contest, while at the same time, the proud champion boxer, Butch, makes the decision of a lifetime.

To pay her back in the same coin, poor Joel summons up the courage to undergo a painless but intricate medical procedure to do the same, utterly unaware that darkness is an essential part of the light. Now, as hurt and angry Joel\'s ugly recollections of Clementine gradually fade away, giving way to a soulless black void, suddenly, he begins having second thoughts, toying with the idea of stopping the irreversible process. In the end, is ignorance really bliss?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nA man awakes disheveled; impulsively, he skips work, heading instead to the shore. On this chilly February day, a woman in orange, hair dyed blue, chats him up: she\'s Clementine, he\'s Joel, shy and sad; by day\'s end, he likes her. The next night she takes him to the frozen Charles River. After, as he drops her off, she asks to sleep at his place, and she runs up to get her toothbrush. Strange things occur: their meeting was not entirely chance, they have a history neither remembers. Our seeing how the lacunae came to be and their discovery of the memory loss take the rest of the film.\r\n-\r\n\r\nJoel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contracts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik, to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel\'s memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew chase him through the maze of his memories, it\'s clear that Joel just can\'t get her out of his head.\r\n-\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\nOn a Valentine Day, Joel Barish feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a guy, Joel, who discovers that his long-time girlfriend, Clementine, has undergone a psychiatrist\'s experimental procedure in which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried for years to get their relationship working fluidly. Frustrated by the idea of still being in love with a woman who doesn\'t remember their time together, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine. The film, which takes place mostly within Joel\'s mind, follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced, and the procedure then goes on to the previous one, which is likewise seen, and then erased. Once the process starts, however, Joel realizes he doesn\'t really want to forget Clementine, so he starts smuggling her away into parts of his memory where she doesn\'t belong which alters other things about his memories as well...\r\n-\r\naustin4577@aol.com','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-08 12:28:54','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7IzQmGnGoM','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+',18),(33,'0910970','WALL·E','WALL·E','WALL·E\r\nУОЛ.И\r\n机器人总动员\r\nVall-I\r\nWall-E\r\nWALL·E - Der Letzte räumt die Erde auf\r\nWall·Y\r\nΓουόλ-Υ\r\nWALL-E\r\n太空奇兵·威E\r\nUôrî\r\nWôrî\r\nウォーリー\r\nVALL-E\r\nWALL·E.

Mesmerized with trinkets of Earth\'s history and show tunes, WALL-E is alone on Earth except for a sprightly pet cockroach. One day, EVE, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to Earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with EVE. WALL-E rescues EVE from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her \"directive\", EVE takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn\'t understand what has happened to his new friend, but, true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim EVE, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness, hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue EVE. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated Earth 700 years earlier. The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily-given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of Earth from returning by stealing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, humans abandon Earth because there is too much trash on it. WALL-E, with habit of picking up everything he finds interesting, lives alone on the planet with a pet cockroach. He has quite a collection of things, from lighters to a working iPod and even a small ring box (without the ring). He even has the last living plant. When a spaceship comes to earth and drops a sleek and dangerous probe EVE to look for a living plant, WALL-E falls in love with her. WALL-E gives her the plant, which makes EVE go into sleep mode. When a spaceship comes to take EVE back, WALL-E too goes with her. What follows is an adventure onboard the Axiom, where people move on hovering chairs and get liquid food which they suck up through a straw. Due to laziness, they have become so fat that they are unable to move. Due to hastily given instructions given to it, auto, the autopilot it tries to get rid of the plant which compels WALL-E, EVE, the pilot and some malfunctioning robots to find a way to retrieve the plant and save the earth.\r\n-\r\nsrijanarora-152-448595\r\n\r\nWALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends his days tidying up the planet, one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years, WALL-E has developed a personality, and he\'s more than a little lonely. Then he spots EVE, a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten WALL-E embarks on his greatest adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIt\'s late in the third millennium, and Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland with nothing able to grow. Several hundred years earlier, a corporation called Buy-N-Large shipped all humans off the planet to live on starships, they biding their time until Earth is able to regenerate itself into an inhabitable planet. They also left WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class) robots on Earth to clean up and compact all the industrial waste. Only one WALL·E remains, it which has gained emotions and the ability to feel. In order to survive emotionally, WALL·E uses whatever it can find as touchstones to past life on Earth. Despite their initial antagonistic encounter, WALL·E befriends an EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a droid sent from the mother ship, Axiom, as a sensor to gauge if life has regenerated on Earth. Not knowing about EVE\'s mission, WALL·E is surprised by EVE\'s interest in a small seedling WALL·E previously found and brought back to its makeshift abode. In EVE needing to take the seedling back to Axiom, WALL·E, not wanting to lose its new friend, hitches a ride as a stowaway to Axiom. A combination of WALL·E making it back to Axiom and EVE bringing back the seedling leads to a risk to both their survival, as AUTO, the automated pilot manning Axiom, has its own agenda against the recolonization of Earth.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-08 12:30:37','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbF6wxmxwBo','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::G\r\nAustria::0\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzechia::U\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nGreece::K\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMalta::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::G\r\nNorway::7\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::0\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::G\r\nSouth Africa::A\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::0\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::G',0),(34,'0993846','The Wolf of Wall Street','Wolf of Wall Street','The Wolf of Wall Street\r\nEl lobo de Wall Street\r\nO Lobo de Wall Street\r\nВълкът от Уолстрийт\r\nLe loup de Wall Street\r\nHua-er Jie zhi lang\r\n华尔街之狼\r\nVuk s Wall Streeta\r\nVlk z Wall Street\r\nWall Streeti hunt\r\nO lykos tis Wall Street\r\nΟ λύκος της Wall Street\r\n華爾街狼人\r\nA Wall Street farkasa\r\nGorg-e Wall Street\r\nHa\'ze\'ev mi\'Wall Street\r\nウルフ・オブ・ウォールストリート\r\nVolstrītas vilks\r\nVolstryto vilkas\r\nWilk z Wall Street\r\nLupul de pe Wall Street\r\nВолк с Уолл-стрит\r\nВук са Вол стрита\r\nVolk z Wall Streeta\r\n華爾街之狼\r\nPara Avcısı\r\nВовк з Волл-стріт\r\nUoll-strit bo\'risi\r\nSói Già Phố Wall',2013,180,8.2,1311401,'English\r\nFrench','United States','Biography\r\nComedy\r\nCrime\r\nDrama','Martin Scorsese','Terence Winter\r\nJordan Belfort','Riza Aziz\r\nRichard Baratta\r\nMarianne Bower\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio\r\nDanny Dimbort\r\nJoel Gotler\r\nTed Griffin\r\nGeorgia Kacandes\r\nJoey McFarland\r\nAlexandra Milchan\r\nMartin Scorsese\r\nAdam Somner\r\nEmma Tillinger Koskoff\r\nIrwin Winkler\r\nRick Yorn','','Leonardo DiCaprio\r\nJonah Hill\r\nMargot Robbie\r\nMatthew McConaughey\r\nKyle Chandler\r\nRob Reiner\r\nJon Bernthal\r\nJon Favreau\r\nJean Dujardin\r\nJoanna Lumley\r\nCristin Milioti\r\nChristine Ebersole\r\nShea Whigham\r\nKatarina Cas\r\nP.J.

So much that companies file their initial public offerings through them. As their status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. They draw attention like no other, throwing lavish parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. That ultimately leads to Belfort featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine, being called \"The Wolf Of Wall St.\". With the FBI onto Belfort\'s trading schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow. Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in a European bank. But with the FBI watching him like a hawk, how long will Belfort and Azoff be able to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-08 12:31:21','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb_UJ3bHiVI','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::16+\r\nChile::18\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21+\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRomania::I.M.-18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::18\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(35,'0230600','The Others','Others','The Others\r\nLos otros\r\nNevidljivi\r\nOs Outros\r\nДругите\r\nLes autres\r\nLos Otros\r\nUljezi\r\nTi druzí\r\nTeised\r\nSkhvebi\r\nOi alloi\r\nΟι άλλοι\r\n不速之嚇\r\nMás világ\r\nHa-Aherim\r\nアザーズ\r\nKiti\r\nInni\r\nCeilalti\r\nДругие\r\nДухови у нама\r\nTí druhí\r\nVsiljivci\r\n神鬼第六感\r\nDiğerleri\r\nes sofom ipova\r\nІнші\r\nThe Darkness',2001,104,7.6,355892,'English','Spain\r\nUnited States\r\nFrance\r\nItaly','Horror\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Alejandro Amenábar','Alejandro Amenábar','Fernando Bovaira\r\nEduardo Chapero-Jackson\r\nTom Cruise\r\nJosé Luis Cuerda\r\nMiguel Ángel González\r\nEmiliano Otegui\r\nSunmin Park\r\nRick Schwartz\r\nPaula Wagner\r\nBob Weinstein\r\nHarvey Weinstein','Alejandro Amenábar','Nicole Kidman\r\nFionnula Flanagan\r\nChristopher Eccleston\r\nAlakina Mann\r\nJames Bentley\r\nEric Sykes\r\nElaine Cassidy\r\nRenée Asherson\r\nGordon Reid\r\nKeith Allen\r\nMichelle Fairley\r\nAlexander Vince\r\nRicardo López\r\nAldo Grilo','Sooner or later she\'ll see them, then everything will be different.\r\n\r\nSometimes the world of the living gets mixed up with the world of the dead.\r\n\r\nSooner Or Later They Will Find You.\r\n\r\n\"No door is to be opened before the previous one is closed\"\r\n\r\nHow do you keep them out, when they\'ve already invited themselves in?\r\n\r\nDo you believe in ghosts ?

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency\'s Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter\'s brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nPerplexed by a string of grisly murders elaborately executed by the elusive mass-killer nicknamed \"Buffalo Bill\", the vulnerable and untried F.B.I. trainee, Clarice Starling, is assigned by the Special Agent, Jack Crawford, to assist in the manhunt. Hoping to attain a clearer perception of the psychopathic serial killer\'s modus operandi, the young investigator reluctantly accepts the help of another hideous monster: the brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic mass-murderer, Dr Hannibal Lecter. Now, with every visit to the manipulative doctor\'s heavily reinforced prison cell, Clarice delves just a little bit deeper into the dark mind of a homicidal maniac; however, how far is she willing to go to unearth pure evil?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nYoung F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to help find a missing woman to save her from a psychopathic serial killer (Ted Levine) who skins his victims. Clarice attempts to gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer by talking to another psychopath: Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who used to be a respected psychiatrist. F.B.I. Special Agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) believes that Lecter, who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator, has the answers to their questions and can help locate the killer. However, Clarice must first gain Lecter\'s confidence before the inmate will give away any information.\r\n-\r\nSami Al-Taher\r\n\r\nClarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young intelligent F.B.I. trainee, has been sent to the Baltimore state hospital for the criminally insane to interview an inmate, Dr. Hannibal \"the cannibal\" Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant renowned psychiatrist turned infamous psychopathic serial killer.

Believing it takes one to know one, the F.B.I. sends trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a demented prisoner who may provide psychological insight and clues to the killer\'s actions. The prisoner is psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant, murderous cannibal who will only help Starling if she feeds his morbid curiosity with details of her own complicated life. This twisted relationship forces Starling to not only confront her psychological demons, but leads her face to face with a demented, heinous killer; an incarnation of evil so powerful, that she may not have the courage, or strength, to stop him.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 04:30:29','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::16+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R15\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',18),(42,'0088247','The Terminator','Terminator','The Terminator\r\nTerminator\r\nO Exterminador do Futuro\r\nТерминатор\r\nTerminátor\r\nTerminaator\r\nTerminaattori\r\nTerminator - förstöraren\r\nTerminator - tuhoaja\r\nThe Terminator - tuhoaja\r\nO exolothreftis\r\nΟ εξολοθρευτής\r\nTerminátor - A halálosztó\r\nA halálosztó\r\nTortímandinn\r\nद टर्मिनेटर\r\nNaboodgar\r\nTamineta\r\nターミネーター\r\nTerminators\r\nTerminatorius\r\nTerminator: El exterminador\r\nDe uitroeier\r\nEl ejecutor\r\nEl exteminador\r\nElektroniczny morderca\r\nO Exterminador Implacável\r\nTerminatorul\r\nExecutorul\r\nКиборг-убийца\r\nDödsängeln\r\n魔鬼終結者\r\nKhon Lek 2029\r\nYok edici\r\nТермінатор\r\nEl Exterminador\r\nKẻ Hủy Diệt',1984,107,8,831457,'English\r\nSpanish','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Action\r\nSci-Fi','James Cameron','James Cameron\r\nGale Anne Hurd\r\nWilliam Wisher','John Daly\r\nDerek Gibson\r\nGale Anne Hurd','Brad Fiedel','Arnold Schwarzenegger\r\nMichael Biehn\r\nLinda Hamilton\r\nPaul Winfield\r\nLance Henriksen\r\nRick Rossovich\r\nBess Motta\r\nEarl Boen\r\nDick Miller\r\nShawn Schepps\r\nBruce M.

The man who will become the future leader of the human resistance against the Machines is now a healthy young boy. However, another Terminator, called the T-1000, is sent back through time by the supercomputer Skynet. This new Terminator is more advanced and more powerful than its predecessor and its mission is to kill John Connor when he\'s still a child. However, Sarah and John do not have to face the threat of the T-1000 alone. Another Terminator (identical to the same model that tried and failed to kill Sarah Connor in 1984) is also sent back through time to protect them. Now, the battle for tomorrow has begun.\r\n-\r\nEric ggg\r\n\r\nIn 1995, one long decade after the Terminator\'s failed assassination mission in The Terminator (1984), a now-ten-year-old John Connor finds himself in foster care, after the imprisonment of his mother, Sarah, at a mental institution. To prevent John from changing the course of history and becoming the leader of the human Resistance Army, the self-aware computer system, Skynet, sends another cybernetic assassin; this time, a nearly indestructible, shape-shifting killer. Now, against the backdrop of an imminent nuclear Armageddon, two unstoppable cyborgs--the antiquated but lethal, T-800, and the far superior, liquid-metal model, T-1000--are after the same vulnerable target. Can Sarah and John avert the coming Judgment Day?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nNearly 10 years have passed since Sarah Connor was targeted for termination by a cyborg from the future. Now her son, John, the future leader of the resistance, is the target for a newer, more deadly terminator. Once again, the resistance has managed to send a protector back to attempt to save John and his mother Sarah.\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nSkynet, the 21st century computer waging a losing war on humans sends a second terminator back in time to destroy the leader of the human resistance while he is still a boy. His mother is the only one who knows of the existence of the Terminators, human-like robots that exist only to kill and are nearly indestructible, and Sarah, the boy\'s mother is currently in a state mental hospital because of her \'delusions\'.\r\n-\r\nJohn Vogel\r\n\r\nIt has been about 10 long years since a Terminator failed to kill Sarah Connor and her unborn son, John. Now, Skynet has sent back another Terminator. This one being more advanced than the last one. John Connor, who is now about ten years old, is the target. The future John sends back a replica of the Terminator that tried to kill him back in time to 1994.

Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful & advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers & leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?\r\n-\r\nDerek O\'Cain\r\n\r\nLiving off-grid--ten long and challenging years after the encounter with the liquid-metal killer in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)--the resilient survivor and now-23-year-old vagabond, John Connor, knows that these are dark and uncertain times. For the third time, the self-aware computer network, Skynet, sends another cyborg assassin--this time, its most efficient and technologically perfect model, the gynoid-like T-X--to terminate the future leader of the humans; however, the Resistance, too, has sent a protector: the reprogrammed but long-obsolete, T-101. Once more, the future is hanging by a thread, and this time, it\'s either us or the cold robots. Is humankind prepared for the Rise of the Machines?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIt is a dark time for the resistance and Skynet is on the verge of going online, the events of the last movie has changed nothing and John must now battle a new Terminator called the T-X. As before, the resistance was able to send another T-800 as a protector for John, and its still a question of which one will reach him first...\r\n-\r\nScott\r\n\r\nOn the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.\r\n-\r\nPaul McLaughlin\r\n\r\nJohn Conner, now an adult, in fear of the events that took place at a young age, lives off the grid--no phone, no job, no credit cards. After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, the T-X or Terminatrix, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife, and has a small upgrade which allows it to mimick humans more. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life...forever.\r\n-\r\nHayden','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 04:32:18','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::R',12),(45,'0438488','Terminator Salvation','Terminator Salvation','Terminator Salvation\r\nTerminator - La salvación\r\nTerminator: Die Erlösung\r\nO Exterminador do Futuro: A Salvação\r\nТерминатор: Спасение\r\nTerminator rédemption\r\nZhongjiezhe 2018\r\nTerminator: Spasenje\r\nTerminátor Salvation\r\nTerminaator: Lunastus\r\nTerminator - Pelastus\r\nTerminator - Räddningen\r\nTerminator renaissance\r\nExolothreftis: I sotiria\r\nΕξολοθρευτής: Η σωτηρία\r\nMeiloi jinsi 2018\r\nWeilai zhanshi 2018\r\nTerminátor - Megváltás\r\nTerminator 4\r\nターミネーター4\r\nTerminators: Glābšana\r\nTerminatorius: išsigelbejimas\r\nTerminator - La Salvación\r\nTerminator - Ocalenie\r\nExterminador Implacável - A Salvação\r\nTerminator - Salvarea\r\nТерминатор: Да придёт спаситель\r\nТерминатор: Спасење\r\nTerminator: Odresitev\r\nTeomineiteo miraejeonjaeng-ui sijak\r\nTerminator: Salvation\r\n魔鬼終結者：未來救贖\r\nTerminatör: Kurtuluş\r\nТермінатор: Спасіння прийде\r\nTerminator Salvation: The Future Begins\r\nT4: Salvation\r\nProject Angel\r\nTerminator: Najotkor\r\nKẻ Hủy Diệt 4: Cứu Rỗi\r\nKẻ Hủy Diệt 4',2009,115,6.5,355058,'English\r\nItalian','United States\r\nGermany\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nItaly','Action\r\nSci-Fi','McG','John Brancato\r\nMichael Ferris','Jeanne Allgood\r\nDerek Anderson\r\nMoritz Borman\r\nKathy Chasen-Hay\r\nSean Cushing\r\nCrystal Dowd\r\nChantal Feghali\r\nBruce Franklin\r\nSteve Gaub\r\nPeter D.

But whose side is he on, and can he be trusted?\r\n\r\nIn 2003, in the Longview State Correctional Facility, the criminal Marcus Wright is on death row, and is convinced by the cancerous Dr. Serena Kogan to donate his body to her research and he accepts. In 2018, after an unsuccessful attack to a Skynet facility, only John Connor survives, but he discovers that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. Out of the blue, Marcus appears naked and with amnesia in the location. Marcus befriends the teenager Kyle Reese and the girl Star who help him to survive the lethal machines and they travel together in a Jeep. Meanwhile the resistance discovers a signal that might turn-off the machines and John offers to test it. When Kyle is captured by a machine and brought to the Skynet headquarters, Marcus decides to help the youngster and heads to Skynet; on the way, he saves Blair Williams who suggests to him that he should meet John Connor first. But Marcus steps on a mine and is submitted to surgery, when a secret about his origins is disclosed.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Skynet has destroyed most of humanity and survivors have been hiding underground from an army of machines, known as \"Terminators\". After a failed attack on a Skynet base, John Connor, the man fated to lead the Resistance is the sole survivor. On the other hand, Marcus Wright, who only remembers being on death row, meets Kyle Reese and it is believed by Connor that he was sent from the future to kill him. Now Marcus and John must unlikely join forces in order to save Kyle Reese and the humans captured by the machines.\r\n-\r\nEmphinix\r\n\r\nIn the not too distant future, John Connor is a key member of the resistance against the machines that have taken over the Earth. From the recordings his mother has left him, he knows he has to find Kyle Reese and send him back to Earth if the future is to occur as it should. Reese is just a teenager now, on the run like many other humans. While in the company of another survivor, Marcus Wright, Kyle is taken prisoner by the machines and transported to Skynet\'s headquarters in San Francisco. Connor sets out to rescue him but is shocked by Wright\'s true nature. Not all is at it seems to be and success is far from guaranteed.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIn a grim 2018--in the wake of Skynet\'s devastating Judgment Day that claimed the lives of billions in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)--the original leader of the Resistance, General Hugh Ashdown, and a now-grown-up John Connor call for a united effort to save the remaining survivors and destroy the self-aware machine network in San Francisco. Now, more than ever, protecting the sixteen-year-old version of Sergeant Kyle Reese becomes the war\'s priority; however, things are further complicated by the arrival of the enigmatic human with the pale memories of death row, Marcus Wright. More and more, as Skynet deploys an army of relentless machines to terminate John and Kyle, humankind\'s salvation lies in the hands of a single rescue team. Is all hope lost?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nSet in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet\'s operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros.

Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor and safeguard the future, an unexpected turn of events creates a fractured time-line. Now, Sgt. Reese finds himself in a new and unfamiliar version of the past, where he is faced with unlikely allies, including the Guardian, dangerous new enemies, and an unexpected new mission: To reset the future.\r\n\r\nJohn Connor, the one leading the human rebels against Skynet, has a plan to attack Skynet but decides not to take part in it and opts instead to prevent Skynet from implementing it\'s contingency plan--to send a terminator to kill the woman who would give birth to John, Sarah Connor. But he fails so he sends his right hand, Kyle Reese who is the one who will sire him, to protect Sarah. And as Reese is leaving he sees John attacked by someone there who is one of Skynet\'s soldiers. When Reese arrives, he discovers a terminator which is not like the ones he\'s encountered. He is saved by Sarah who knows who he is and why he is there. He also discovers she has a terminator with her. She tells him that the terminator he encountered was sent to kill her when she was nine and the terminator, with her, was sent to save her and has been her companion and guardian ever since. They intercepted the terminator he followed and plan to use it\'s chip to activate a time machine they built to go to 1997 which is when Skynet was activated but Reese says they should not go to 1997 but to 2017. He says that there\'s a voice or memory that tells him to remember the date because it\'s when they can stop Skynet. So Sarah and Reese go, the terminator stays behind and says he\'ll meet them when they arrive but they get arrested when they arrive and someone unexpected show up.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIt is 2029. Since 1997 humans have been engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the robots of Skynet. One of the leaders of the human forces is John Connor. He sends Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor. Upon arriving in 1984 he discovers that Sarah Connor already has a protector, a largely-obsolete robot / Terminator. However, Skynet has also sent back a Terminator.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nOn the brink of ending the War against the Machines--more than three decades after the nuclear Armageddon in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)--John Connor sends his right-hand man, Lieutenant Kyle Reese, to 1984 Los Angeles.

Now, Sarah has a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator by her side, planning to travel forward in time, in 2017 San Francisco, to prevent the self-aware computer network from going online.

Once more, the self-aware computer system sends back in time its most sophisticated android assassin--the nearly indestructible terminator made of advanced mimetic poly-alloy, Rev-9--to exterminate young Dani in 2020 Mexico City.

In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nEvery age has its visionaries who leave, in the wake of their genius, a changed world--but rarely without a battle over exactly what happened and who was there at the moment of creation. \"The Social Network\" explores the moment at which Facebook was invented--through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception. The movie moves from the halls of Harvard to the cubicles of Palo Alto to capture the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making--and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. In the midst of the chaos are Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the brilliant Harvard student who conceived a Web site; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), once Zuckerberg\'s close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who brought Facebook to Silicon Valley\'s venture capitalists; and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence), the Harvard classmates who asserted that Zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. Each has his own narrative, his own version of the Facebook story in this multi-level portrait of 21st Century success--both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nAs told through flashbacks via deposition hearings for two concurrent lawsuits, the development and early days of the social networking website Facebook is presented. Harvard students Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin - officially listed as the co-founders of the website - were once best friends. Based on an on-line blog about his ex-girlfriend and a site he developed allowing its users to rate the hotness factor of girls on campus, Zuckerberg, who exhibited a streak of arrogance, was asked by fellow Harvardites, wealthy twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, and their friend Divya Narendra, to enter into an agreement to develop a social networking website specifically for Harvard students, the attraction for people to visit it being its exclusivity solely to Harvard students. Zuckerberg agreed. Zuckerberg, with financing from his friend Saverin, decided instead to develop his own website without telling the \"Winklevi\" (as he calls the twins) and Narenda. Zuckerberg\'s assertion was that he never used a line of code provided by the three in his work. As \"thefacebook\" as it was then called began to blossom, the twins and Narenda had to figure out what to do to regain what they believed their intellectual property without having to sue, since that\'s not what gentlemanly Harvardites do. As the site was brought to more and more university campuses, Zuckerberg and Saverin began to have a difference of opinion: Saverin wanted to sell ad space to generate revenue (as he had been the website\'s sole financier and he had profit mentality based on being an economics major), while Zuckerberg, never one interested in money, didn\'t want to go that route as the ads would make the site lose its \"cool\" factor, which made it popular. The site attracted the attention of the founder of Napster, Sean Parker, whose own dot com life had its spectacular ups and spectacular downs. As Parker ingratiated himself into Facebook\'s life (much to Saverin\'s chagrin) and as Zuckerberg began increasingly to side with Parker, Saverin slowly began to be phased out of both Zuckerberg\'s personal and professional life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nNot very good at expressing himself in person, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) first alienates himself from his girlfriend, who feels conversing with him is like working the \'stairmaster\', while taking strong exception to his condescending remarks towards her. He and his buddy, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), plagiarize a proposed networking website from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, made exclusively for Harvadites - re-naming it \'The Facebook\'. This site connects students, describes what drives life in college, who\'s single, and how to hook-up with girls. Both then are approached by Napster-fame Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), and upon his advise, \'The\' is removed - giving birth to the now-revolutionary \'Facebook\' - that can be accessed by anyone worldwide - not just a few exclusive campuses. But his competitiveness, inability to communicate, and the urge to be number one, will alienate him, and result in two lawsuits - one from the Winklevoss twins - and the second from none other than Eduardo himself.\r\n-\r\nrAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nThe story of the creators of Facebook and the subsequent legal battles that stretched out over several years. Told mostly in flashbacks while Mark Zuckerman gives depositions in two lawsuits, the idea of a shareable social information site came to him one night after he hacked into his school\'s database and published the photos of all the women at the school. One of his roommates, Eduardo Saverin, provides the upfront financing and Zuckerman deftly outmaneuvers two other students who had a similar idea. The relationship with Saverin deteriorates and he soon finding himself on the outside looking in.

Titanic.\r\n\r\n84 years later, a 100 year-old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story to her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich on the Keldysh about her life set in April 10th 1912, on a ship called Titanic when young Rose boards the departing ship with the upper-class passengers and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her fiancé, Caledon Hockley. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra\r\n\r\nAfter winning a trip on the RMS Titanic during a dockside card game, American Jack Dawson spots the society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater who is on her way to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob fiancé Caledon Hockley. Rose feels helplessly trapped by her situation and makes her way to the aft deck and thinks of suicide until she is rescued by Jack. Cal is therefore obliged to invite Jack to dine at their first-class table where he suffers through the slights of his snobbish hosts. In return, he spirits Rose off to third-class for an evening of dancing, giving her the time of her life. Deciding to forsake her intended future all together, Rose asks Jack, who has made his living making sketches on the streets of Paris, to draw her in the nude wearing the invaluable blue diamond Cal has given her. Cal finds out and has Jack locked away. Soon afterwards, the ship hits an iceberg and Rose must find Jack while both must run from Cal even as the ship sinks deeper into the freezing water.\r\n-\r\nhEmRaJ (gavin_coolhgr@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nDeep on the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man\'s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory. Almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic\'s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nDeep-sea explorer Brock Lovett has reached the most famous shipwreck of all - the Titanic. Emerging with a safe believed to contain a diamond called \'The Heart of the Ocean\', he discovers the safe does not hold the diamond but a drawing of a beautiful woman wearing it. When Brock is later interviewed on TV, he shows the drawing to the cameras, and a 100-year-old woman named Rose Calvert living in Michigan recognizes the woman in the drawing - herself! On a visit to Brock\'s explorer ship over the wreck, Rose tells her story of the Titanic and its ill-fated voyage. Engaged to a would-be steel magnate, Caledon Hockley, she boards the Titanic\'s first-class suites with him and her mother in Southampton. Also boarding are Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi, after a lucky poker game wins them tickets in steerage. When Rose attempts suicide by jumping off the stern in third-class, Jack pulls her back onto the ship... and a bond is forged between them as Jack is invited by her into first-class the following day. Rose\'s mother and Caledon Hockley try desperate measures to keep them apart. But that strategy goes out the window when the Titanic collides with an iceberg, and due to a design flaw begins to sink - despite being proclaimed \'unsinkable\'. Now Rose and Jack must fight to stay alive, but is young Jack already doomed because of his lower status as a steerage passenger?\r\n-\r\nDerek O\'Cain','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 04:34:16','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::10\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::12\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::TV-PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(50,'0360486','Constantine','Constantine','Constantine\r\nКонстантин\r\nKonstantin\r\nConstantine - A démonvadász\r\nकोंस्टेनटाइन\r\nコンスタンティン\r\nKonstantīns\r\nKonstantinas\r\nConstantin\r\nКонстантин: Повелитель тьмы\r\nKonštantín\r\n康斯坦汀：驅魔神探\r\nКонстантин: Володар темряви\r\nJohn Constantine: Hellblazer\r\nHellblazer\r\nNgười Đi Dưới Địa Ngục',2005,121,7,330608,'English\r\nFilipino\r\nTagalog','United States\r\nGermany','Action\r\nFantasy\r\nHorror\r\nMystery','Francis Lawrence','Jamie Delano\r\nGarth Ennis\r\nKevin Brodbin\r\nKevin Brodbin\r\nFrank A.

John himself has been to Hell and knows that he is destined to return there on his death - but hopes his good deeds may find him a place in Heaven.

As he grows up, he finds a way to remember these lost memories and a supernatural way to alter his life by reading his journal.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Evan Treborn was afflicted with blackouts where he would be in one place one minute and then another the next, remembering absolutely nothing in-between. Now all grown up and in college, he decides to read from an old journal he wrote to remember stuff that might have happened in the in-between, and suddenly finds himself back at a certain point in his life. He realizes that those blackouts he had were actually empty spaces of time he had to fill up later in life. Attempting to use this ability to undo unpleasant past events, Evan starts to find that every time he goes back and tries to fix things, he ends up making everything worse. How can he prevent more tragedies from happening and save the one girl he ever loved, Kayleigh (Amy Smart)?\r\n-\r\nLenny at 13\r\n\r\nEvan Treborn grows up in a small town with his single, working mother and his friends.

Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks\' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"Jessica\", really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks\' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks\' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong\'s housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nJobless, penniless, and, above all, hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch, Ki-taek, and his equally unambitious family--his supportive wife, Chung-sook; his cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung, and his college-age son, Ki-woo--occupy themselves by working for peanuts in their squalid basement-level apartment. Then, by sheer luck, a lucrative business proposition will pave the way for an ingeniously insidious scheme, as Ki-woo summons up the courage to pose as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the affluent Park family. Now, the stage seems set for an unceasing winner-take-all class war. How does one get rid of a parasite?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nAfter his rich friend asks him to fake qualifications and take his tutor role to a rich teenage girl so none will try to date her in his absence, the poor lead takes up the offer & enters the rich yet gullible family. He then cons his way into the family, dates his friend\'s crush & schemes to get all his family get a job under the family. When the owners leave the house on vacation they move in & undergo a bizarre encounter which changes the lives of everyone.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 16:34:35','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEcuador::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::10\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNigeria::12\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R12\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C18',12),(58,'2911666','John Wick','John Wick','John Wick\r\nSin Control\r\nCon Vik\r\nDe Volta ao Jogo\r\nДжон Уик\r\nジョン・ウィック\r\nDžons Viks\r\nDžonas Vikas\r\nOtro día para matar\r\nOtro Dia Para Matar\r\nJohn Wick: Sin control\r\nЏон Вик\r\nJohn Wick (Otro día para matar)\r\n捍衛任務\r\nДжон Вік\r\nДжон Уік\r\nSin control\r\nJon Uik\r\nSát Thủ John Wick',2014,101,7.4,595761,'English\r\nRussian\r\nHungarian','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nChina','Action\r\nCrime\r\nThriller','Chad Stahelski\r\nDavid Leitch','Derek Kolstad','Darren Blumenthal\r\nSam X.

Now, only blood can quench the boogeyman\'s thirst for retribution.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-30','','2020-04-09 16:39:20','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C16',18),(59,'4425200','John Wick: Chapter 2','John Wick: Chapter 2','John Wick: Chapter 2\r\nJohn Wick 2: Un nuevo día para matar\r\nJohn Wick 2: Un Nuevo Día Para Matar\r\nJohn Wick: Um Novo Dia para Matar\r\nДжон Уик 2\r\nJohn Wick: chapitre 2\r\nJohn Wick 2\r\nJohn Wick: Kapitel 2\r\nJohn Wick: Κεφάλαιο 2\r\nJohn Wick: 2. felvonás\r\nJohn Wick - Capitolo 2\r\nジョン・ウィック　チャプター2\r\nDžons Viks 2\r\nDžonas Vikas 2\r\nJohn Wick Chapter 2\r\nЏон Вик 2\r\nJohn Wick: Pacto de sangre\r\n捍衛任務2：殺神回歸\r\nДжон Уік 2\r\nДжон Вік 2\r\nJon Uik 2\r\nJon Uik: 2-qism\r\nSát Thủ John Wick: Phần 2',2017,122,7.5,407501,'English\r\nItalian\r\nRussian\r\nSign Languages\r\nHebrew','United States\r\nItaly\r\nHong Kong\r\nCanada','Action\r\nCrime\r\nThriller','Chad Stahelski','Derek Kolstad\r\nDerek Kolstad','Robert Bernacchi\r\nKevin Scott Frakes\r\nBasil Iwanyk\r\nErica Lee\r\nDavid Leitch\r\nQiuyun Long\r\nJennifer Madeloff\r\nMarco Valerio Pugini\r\nVishal Rungta\r\nHolly S.

After killing a member of the shadowy international assassin\'s guild, the High Table, John Wick is excommunicado, but the world\'s most ruthless hit men and women await his every turn.\r\n\r\nAfter gunning down a member of the High Table -- the shadowy international assassin\'s guild -- legendary hit man John Wick finds himself stripped of the organization\'s protective services. Now stuck with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way through the streets of New York as he becomes the target of the world\'s most ruthless killers.\r\n-\r\npratham048\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is on the run for two reasons, as he is being hunted for a global $14 million dollar open contract on his life, and for breaking a central rule: taking a life on Continental Hotel grounds. The victim was a member of the High Table who ordered the open contract. John should have already been executed, except the Continental\'s manager, Winston, has given him a one-hour grace period before he\'s \'Excommunicado\' - membership revoked, banned from all services and cut off from other members. John uses the service industry to stay alive as he fights and kills his way out of New York City.\r\n-\r\nSanthosh\r\n\r\nHeavily outgunned and with a glorious bounty placed on his head after the blood-soaked events in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), the legendary virtuoso of death, John Wick, finds himself all on his own in the dark underbelly of Manhattan\'s vast urban battlefield. With every ambitious nobody in the business itching to terminate the excommunicated cardinal of destruction, John has to do battle with pitilessly endless waves of the High Table\'s murderous cut-throats, against the backdrop of a fatal mistake at the neutral Continental Hotel, and a long-standing feud over an innocent puppy. Indeed, many have tried to claim John\'s head; however, dead men can\'t spend money. Now, the artist of suffering prepares for war.

Special operatives Valerian and Laureline must race to identify the marauding menace and safeguard not just Alpha, but the future of the universe.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-eighth century, space station Alpha is a city where beings from different planets live together exchanging their knowledge and culture. Peace is granted by a human force, including Major Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and his partner Sergeant Laureline (Cara Delevingne). They are assigned by the Defense Minister (Herbie Hancock) to retrieve the last species of converter in a dangerous mission. They succeed and back to Alpha, unknown humanoids abduct Commander Arun Filitt (Clive Owen) expecting to steal the converter. They head to a forbidden area that is infected, but Valerian and Laureline follow them and disclose a hidden secret about the race and the infected area.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-eighth century, due to cooperation between the Earth\'s countries (beginning with the ASTP of 1975) and extra-terrestrial peoples, the former International Space Station has been added to until its mass threatens to cause it to fall out of orbit. Relocated to deep space using a set of trustees, it becomes Alpha, a space-travelling city inhabited by millions of species from thousands of planets. A special Police division is created by the \"United Human Federation\" (a world government formed by a federation of Earth\'s countries) to preserve peace through the galaxy, including happy-go-lucky Major Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and his partner, no-nonsense Sergeant Laureline (Cara Delevingne).\r\n\r\nFar into the future, Valerian and Laureline must save the universe from an intergalactic threat that jeopardises space-time itself.

In the twenty-eighth century, Major Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and Sergeant Laureline (Cara Delevingne) are a team of special operatives charged with maintaining order throughout the human territories. Under assignment from the Defense Minister (Herbie Hancock), the two embark on a mission to the astonishing city of Alpha - an ever-expanding metropolis where species from all over the universe have converged over centuries to share knowledge, intelligence, and cultures with each other.

Ten years after a forced separation, Adam sets out on a dangerous quest to reconnect with his love.\r\n\r\nAdam is a seemingly ordinary guy in a very extraordinary universe. He lives humbly trying to make ends meet, but his romantic spirit holds on to the memory of a girl he loved once upon a time from another world, an inverted affluent world with its own gravity, directly above but beyond reach... a girl named Eden. Their childhood flirtation becomes an impossible love. But when he catches a glimpse of grownup Eden on television, nothing will get in the way of getting her back... Not even the law or science!\r\n-\r\nOnyx Films\r\n\r\nEver since Adam (Jim Sturgess) and Eden (Kirsten Dunst) fell in love as teens, their bond has faced astronomical odds. The pair are separated not just by social class and a political system bent on keeping them apart, but also by a freak planetary condition: they live on twinned worlds with gravities that pull in opposite directions -- he on the poverty-stricken planet below, she on the wealthy, exploitative world above. Their budding but illicit romance screeches to a tragic halt when interplanetary-border patrol agents catch them and Eden suffers an apparently fatal fall. But when, ten years later, Adam learns she is alive and working at a vast corporation whose towering headquarters connects their planets, he sets out on a dangerous quest to infiltrate the company and the upper world to reconnect with her.\r\n-\r\nMillennium Entertainment\r\n\r\nIn a unique solar system that possesses double gravity, the two planets in the system coexist as one on top of the other. Life on one is seen as being upside down to the other, although what is considered the upper world more privileged, and the lower more disadvantaged. The gravity that exists on one is specific to all matter on that planet, meaning that any matter on one could not exist on the other, it which would just float away within that atmosphere. Inverse matter exists which would be able to provide that gravity specific to the other planet, however it is unstable in lasting only an hour or so before it burns off. The only official contact allowed between the two worlds is by and through Transworld, a company created in the upper world to rape the lower world of its resources for sale back to the lower world at inflated prices. They also police any unauthorized interaction between the two worlds. It is within this situation that Adam Kirk from the lower world, and Eden Moore from the upper world exist, they who met as children at the highest points on their respective planets and fell in love as teenagers. They defied the law and gravity to be together. Adam attributes all his problems to Transworld in the literal and figurative death of his family, and Eden falling to her death in the authorities discovering their unauthorized time together. It\'s now ten years after that latter incident when Adam sees Eden on a television broadcast, she an employee of Transworld. Still in love with her, Adam believes the only way to reconnect with her is to get a job with Transworld which at least allows some transaction between employees of the two worlds. He is able to get that job as he has been working on an anti-gravity beauty cream, using the family secret of pink bee pollen which is unique to those two mountains where the pink bees gather pollen from both worlds. What Adam is unaware of is that Eden suffers from amnesia from a concussion that fateful day ten years ago which led to her losing memory of anything before that day, including Adam. With the willing and unwitting help of Bob Boruchowitz, his upper world colleague at Transworld, Adam tries to prove his and Eden\'s love can overcome all the obstacles facing their reunion and union.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn an alternate universe where twinned worlds have opposite gravities, a young man battles interplanetary prejudice and the laws of physics in his quest to reunite with the long-lost girl of his dreams in this visually stunning romantic adventure that poses the question: what if love was stronger than gravity?','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 09:30:23','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nCanada::G\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13',13),(64,'1343092','The Great Gatsby','Great Gatsby','The Great Gatsby\r\nEl gran Gatsby\r\nO Grande Gatsby\r\nВеликият Гетсби\r\nGatsby le magnifique\r\nVeliki Gatsby\r\nVelký Gatsby\r\nDen store Gatsby\r\nSuur Gatsby\r\nThe Great Gatsby - Kultahattu\r\nDidi getsbi\r\nDer große Gatsby\r\nO yperohos Gatsby\r\nΟ υπέροχος Γκάτσμπυ\r\nA nagy Gatsby\r\nGatsby ha\'gadol\r\nIl grande Gatsby\r\n華麗なるギャツビー\r\nLielais Getsbijs\r\nDidysis Getsbis\r\nWielki Gatsby\r\nMarele Gatsby\r\nВеликий Гэтсби\r\nВелики Гетсби\r\nVeľký Gatsby\r\n大亨小傳\r\nMuhteşem Gatsby\r\nВеликий Ґетсбі\r\nĐại Gia Gatsby',2013,143,7.2,518333,'English','Australia\r\nUnited States','Drama\r\nRomance','Baz Luhrmann','Baz Luhrmann\r\nCraig Pearce\r\nF.

Scott Fitzgerald\'s Long Island-set novel, where Midwesterner Nick Carraway is lured into the lavish world of his neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Soon enough, however, Carraway will see through the cracks of Gatsby\'s nouveau riche existence, where obsession, madness, and tragedy await.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nNew York,1929. Bond-seller Nick Carraway, in a sanitarium for depression and alcoholism, is persuaded by his doctor to write a therapeutic account of what put him there. Nick\'s journal describes how, seven years earlier, he had moved to a tiny house on Long Island adjoining the sumptuous mansion owned by enigmatic neighbour, the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby. After attending one of Gatsby\'s legendary parties Nick is asked by Gatsby to arrange a meeting with his cousin, Daisy, now married to the brutish and philandering Tom Buchanan, who was Gatsby\'s true love, prior to war service. As Nick complies he comes to see that Gatsby, once a poor boy, has recreated himself as a fascinating millionaire purely to win Daisy back but the events of a drunken afternoon conspire to bring about an ending which is anything but happy.\r\n-\r\ndon @ minifie-1\r\n\r\nMidwest native Nick Carraway arrives in 1922 New York in search of the American dream. Nick, a would-be writer, moves in next-door to millionaire Jay Gatsby and across the bay from his cousin Daisy and her philandering husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton). Thus, Nick becomes drawn into the captivating world of the wealthy and -- as he bears witness to their illusions and deceits -- pens a tale of impossible love, dreams, and tragedy.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIt\'s the spring of 1922, and wide-eyed Midwesterner Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) has just moved to New York City in pursuit of the American Dream. Settling into a home next door to wealthy Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), Carraway grows increasingly fascinated by the elaborate parties held at his new neighbor\'s estate. Meanwhile, across the bay, Carraway\'s cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) flounders in her marriage to philandering aristocrat Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Inspired by the debauchery on display at Gatsby\'s wild parties and the lives of the wealthy elite, Carraway begins putting pen to paper as it gradually becomes clear that his cousin and the millionaire share a complicated romantic past that remains unresolved..\r\n\r\nA lavish world of decadence and ebullience awaits the innocent Midwesterner and aspiring writer, Nick Carraway, in F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s cinematic adaptation of The Great Gatsby, as he moves into a little cottage in Long Island during the Roaring Twenties. In pursuit of the elusive American Dream, instead, the humble bond-seller strikes an acquaintance with his mysterious, self-made millionaire neighbour, Jay Gatsby, whose extravagant bacchanalian gatherings are the talk of West Egg. Instantly drawn into fabulous Gatsby\'s dazzling nouveau-riche world, Nick soon becomes entangled in Jay\'s impossible love triangle and his unrequited passion for the former\'s married cousin, Daisy, as overpowering impulses and fervent desires pave the way for bitter heartbreak and blood-soaked tragedy. Was it all just a fleeting illusion?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nAn ambitious stockbroker moves to New York and is befriended by a mysterious millionaire named Jay Gatsby.

After an incident that occurs one night, chaos erupts and now Thomas needs to team up with a large number of gladers, destroy the cyborg monsters that haunt the glade (called grievers) and, if he can, form an escape.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:17:08','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(71,'4046784','Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials','Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials','Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\r\nMaze Runner: Prueba de fuego\r\nMaze Runner: Prova de Fogo\r\nЛабиринтът: В обгорените земи\r\nL\'épreuve: La terre brûlée\r\nMaze Runner: A Prueba de Fuego\r\nLabirint: Kroz spaljenu zemlju\r\nLabyrint: Zkoušky ohněm\r\nMaze Runner 2: Infernoet\r\nLabyrintti - Aavikkokokeet\r\nLabyrintti: Aavikkokokeet\r\nLe Labyrinthe : La Terre brûlée\r\nMaze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Brandwüste\r\nΟ λαβύρινθος: Πύρινες δοκιμασίες\r\nAz útvesztő: Tűzpróba\r\nHa\'ratz ba\'mavokh: mivkhanei ha\'kviya\r\nMaze Runner - La fuga\r\nメイズ・ランナー2 砂漠の迷宮\r\nLabirinta skrējējs: Ugunskristības\r\nBėgantis labirintu: išbandymai ugnimi\r\nMaze Runner: Ildprøven\r\nWięzień labiryntu: Próby ognia\r\nWięzień labiryntu 2: Próby ognia\r\nMaze Runner: Provas de Fogo\r\nLabirintul: Încercările focului\r\nБегущий в лабиринте: Испытание огнем\r\nЛавиринт - Бег кроз згариште\r\nLabyrint: Zhorenisko\r\nLabirint: pogorišče\r\nEl corredor del laberinto: Las pruebas\r\n移動迷宮：焦土試煉\r\nLabirent: Alev Deneyleri\r\nТой, що біжить лабіринтом: Випробування вогнем\r\nMaze Runner 2\r\nMaze Runner II\r\nMaze Runner II: The Scorch Trials\r\nMaze Runner 2: The Scorch Trials\r\nLabirint yuguruvchisi: Olov iskanjasida\r\nLabirint yuguruvchisi 2\r\nGiải Mã Mê Cung: Thử Nghiệm Đất Cháy',2015,131,6.3,240010,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Wes Ball','T.S.

Thomas (Dylan O\'Brien) and his fellow Gladers face their greatest challenge yet: searching for clues about the mysterious and powerful organization known as WCKD. Their journey takes them to the Scorch, a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles. Teaming up with resistance fighters, the Gladers take on WCKD\'s vastly superior forces and uncover its shocking plans for them all.\r\n-\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\nAfter surviving the first Trial set by the creators: the Maze, Thomas, Newt, Minho and the other ravaged Gladers must survive in a decimated world overcome with the deadly disease known as the Flare.

They meet other survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated neither alive nor dead. Further, his group will be the next to be guinea pigs. Thomas and Aris succeed in escaping with the other Gladers from the facility and they decide to search for the resistance group called The Right Arm which is hidden in the mountains. Along their journey, they find a destroyed, post-apocalyptic world; they meet Cranks, zombies infected by the Flare virus; they sustain the loss of a friend; they face a lethal lightening storm in the desert and a dangerous group of survivors; and they are betrayed by a friend. Now Thomas and his friends want revenge against the WCKD and Thomas vows to kill Ava Paige.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\n6 months after the events of the maze runner, Thomas, Teresa, Newt, Winston, Minho, Winston, and the other gladers who survived the maze have been at peace until now. They are put to a citadel run by W.C.K.D (world catastrophe killzone department) where every night, other humans are brought to a lab and are crucified. When Thomas, the other gladers, and a lonely boy named Eris, hear about this, they escape and end up in a terrain known as the \"scortch\", which is a desert-like landscape that shows the world is devastated, and now must overcome its obstacles and escape W.C.K.D\r\n\r\nAfter miraculously escaping the death defying Maze, Thomas and the fellow surviving gladers try and survive the scorch. A massive desert with a dark secret. The flare. The Flare is a disease that crazes the mind. WCKD try to hunt the gladers and use their blood to find a cure to this devastating illness.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a flashback to a young boy, Thomas, being dropped off by his mother and taken in by scientist Ava Paige and troops of the organization called WCKD, along with other abandoned children. WCKD places the children in a walled maze in a glade as part of its scientific testing. Years later, shortly after being rescued from the Maze, Thomas and the remaining Gladers - Teresa Agnes, Newt, Minho, Frypan, and Winston - are taken to a facility run by Mr. Janson. He explains that the facility is a safe haven, protecting them from WCKD, the Flare virus and the \"Cranks\", and provides them clothes, food, and sanitation, where other survivors of multiple mazes are also present. Thomas becomes curious about their activities and manages to find out what is really happening behind the closed doors. With help from Aris, the first maze survivor to end up in the facility, Thomas discovers that WCKD\'s leader, Ava, is still alive and that Mr. Janson is really working for WCKD, when they discuss experiments on the Immunes and that Janson has yet to find the Right Arm, a resistance group located in the mountains. The group, including Aris, escapes the facility, and Janson orders his WCKD troops to track them down, as they find themselves in the deserted outside world - the Scorch..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:38:14','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::13\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(72,'4500922','Maze Runner: The Death Cure','Maze Runner: The Death Cure','Maze Runner: The Death Cure\r\nMaze Runner: La Cura Mortal\r\nThe Maze Runner: The Death Cure\r\nMaze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Todeszone\r\nMaze Runner: A Cura Mortal\r\nЛабиринтът: Последният кандидат\r\nL\'épreuve: Le remède mortel\r\nMaze Runner: La cura mortal\r\nLabirint: Lijek smrti\r\nLabyrint: Vražedná léčba\r\nMaze Runner: Dødskuren\r\nLabürindijooksja: Surma ravim\r\nLabyrintti - Tappava lääke\r\nLe Labyrinthe : Le Remède mortel\r\nΟ λαβύρινθος: Θεραπεία θανάτου\r\nΟ λαβύρινθος: Η τελική δοκιμασία\r\nAz útvesztő: Halálkúra\r\nHa\'ratz ba\'mavokh: Troufat ha\'ma\'vet\r\nMaze Runner - La rivelazione\r\nメイズ・ランナー　最期の迷宮\r\nLabirinta skrējējs: Pretnāves zāles\r\nBegantis labirintu: vaistai nuo mirties\r\nMaze Runner: la cura mortal\r\nWięzień labiryntu: Lek na śmierć\r\nWięzień labiryntu 3: Lek na śmierć\r\nLabirintul: Tratament letal\r\nБегущий в лабиринте: Лекарство от смерти\r\nLavirint 3: Smrtonosni lek\r\nLabyrint: Smrteľná liečba\r\nLabirint: Zaton\r\nEl corredor del laberinto: La cura mortal\r\n移動迷宮：死亡解藥\r\nLabirent: Son İsyan\r\nТой, що біжить лабіринтом: Ліки від смерті\r\nMaze Runner 3\r\nMaze Runner 3: The Death Cure\r\nMaze Runner III\r\nMaze Runner III: The Death Cure\r\nLabirint yuguruvchisi: O\'limga qarshi dori\r\nLabirint yuguruvchisi 3\r\nGiải Mã Mê Cung: Lối Thoát Tử Thần',2018,143,6.3,130233,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Wes Ball','T.S.

Coming out of tiny Macedonia, Alexander led his armies against the mighty Persian Empire, drove west to Egypt, and finally made his way east to India. This movie concentrated on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaistion (Jared Leto). Alexander died young, of illness, at the age of thirty-two. Alexander\'s conquests paved the way for the spread of Greek culture (facilitating the spread of Christianity centuries later), and removed many of the obstacles that might have prevented the expansion of the Roman Empire. In other words, the world we know today might never have been if not for Alexander\'s bloody, yet unifying, conquest.\r\n-\r\naustin4577@aol.com\r\n\r\nThis movie traces the short, but adventurous life of the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) (Colin Farrell), who conquered almost the entire known world of his era. From his childhood as the son of King Philip II (Val Kilmer), to ascending the throne at age twenty in 336 B.C. upon his father\'s murder, and starting in 334 B.C., Alexander crossed into Asia on his eleven-year conquest of the known world. From his conquests of Egypt, to battles with the Persians and the capture of Babylon, operations near Maracanda and in Afghanistan, and pushing all the way to India where he reigned unchallenged before his sudden death at the age of thirty-two. Though Alexander made use of the well-oiled army created by his father, he pushed the limits of Macedonian and Greek power to levels of which King Philip II (Val Kilmer) could not have dreamed.\r\n\r\nHistorical, glamorous biopic (with mystical and religious elements) about the life of famous Macedonian ruler and conqueror Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) (Colin Farrell), mainly concentrating on his youth and his conquering of Persia and India. The son of Macedonian King Phillip II (Val Kilmer) and his wife Olympias (Angelina Jolie) became King when he was twenty-years-old and died at the age of thirty-two, by this time having conquered ninety percent of the world as it was explored by the time he lived, ruling over parts of three continents and several countries.\r\n-\r\nsmoothhoney1265','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:38:47','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R',12),(76,'1065073','Boyhood','Boyhood','Boyhood\r\nBoyhood: Momentos de una vida\r\nBoyhood: Da Infância à Juventude\r\nЮношество\r\nJeunesse\r\nBoyhood, Momentos de una Vida\r\nOdrastanje\r\nChlapectví\r\nPoisipõli\r\nΜεγαλώνοντας\r\nSráckor\r\nHitbagrout\r\nRoku-sai no boku ga, otona ni naru made.\r\n6-sai no boku ga, otona ni naru made.\r\n6才のボクが、大人になるまで。\r\nPuikas gadi\r\nVaikystė\r\nBoyhood: momentos de una vida\r\nBoyhood: Momentos de Uma Vida\r\n12 ani de copilarie\r\nBoyhood. 12 ani de copilãrie\r\nОтрочество\r\nОдрастање\r\nChlapčenstvo\r\nFantovska leta\r\nBoyhood (Momentos de una vida)\r\n年少時代\r\nÇocukluk\r\nЮність\r\nThe Untitled 12 Year Project\r\nGrowing Up\r\nThời Thơ Ấu',2014,165,7.9,348183,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Drama','Richard Linklater','Richard Linklater','Sandra Adair\r\nCaroline Kaplan\r\nRichard Linklater\r\nKirsten McMurray\r\nVincent Palmo Jr.\r\nJonathan Sehring\r\nJohn Sloss\r\nCathleen Sutherland\r\nAnne Walker-McBay','','Ellar Coltrane\r\nPatricia Arquette\r\nElijah Smith\r\nLorelei Linklater\r\nSteven Chester Prince\r\nBonnie Cross\r\nSydney Orta\r\nLibby Villari\r\nEthan Hawke\r\nMarco Perella\r\nJamie Howard\r\nAndrew Villarreal\r\nShane Graham\r\nTess Allen\r\nRyan Power\r\nSharee Fowler\r\nMark Finn\r\nCharlie Sexton\r\nByron Jenkins\r\nHolly Moore\r\nDavid Blackwell\r\nBarbara Chisholm\r\nMatthew Martinez-Arndt\r\nCassidy Johnson\r\nCambell Westmoreland\r\nJennifer Griffin\r\nGarry Peters\r\nMerrilee McCommas\r\nTamara Jolaine\r\nJordan Howard\r\nAndrew Bunten\r\nTyler Strother\r\nEvie Thompson\r\nBrad Hawkins\r\nSavannah Welch\r\nMika Odom\r\nSinjin Venegas\r\nNick Krause\r\nDerek Chase Hickey\r\nAngela Rawna\r\nMegan Devine\r\nJenni Tooley\r\nLandon Collier\r\nRoland Ruiz\r\nRichard Andrew Jones\r\nKaren Jones\r\nGordon Friday\r\nTom McTigue\r\nSam Dillon\r\nMartel Summers\r\nDavid Clark\r\nZoe Graham\r\nJessie Tilton\r\nRichard Robichaux\r\nWill Harris\r\nIndica Shaw\r\nBruce Salmon\r\nWayne Sutton\r\nJoe Sundell\r\nSean Tracey\r\nBen Hodges\r\nDaniel Zeh\r\nChris Doubek\r\nAndrea McKinnon\r\nMona Lee Fultz\r\nBill Wise\r\nAlina Linklater\r\nCharlotte Linklater\r\nGenevieve Kinney\r\nElijah Ford\r\nKyle Crusham\r\nConrad Choucroun\r\nMaximillian McNamara\r\nTaylor Weaver\r\nJessi Mechler\r\nVirginia Allee\r\nRenne Araujo\r\nMarina Arellano\r\nBrad Ausmus\r\nGreg Baglia\r\nJonathan Bell\r\nDeanna Brochin\r\nJayson Champion\r\nRoger Clemens\r\nLise\' Creed\r\nKen Edwards\r\nMaria Engler\r\nEvan Freeze\r\nJustin Jacobs\r\nAmber Jaycox\r\nSamantha Kelly\r\nKaitlyn King\r\nJason Lane\r\nStephen Latham\r\nElizabeth Lestina\r\nAlexander Lu\r\nMarian Luntz\r\nNatalie Makenna\r\nDoug Mansolino\r\nHeather Materne\r\nRissa Medlenka\r\nCraig Alan Ries\r\nCourtney Tailor\r\nCorey Terrell\r\nLupe Trejo\r\nJohnny Walter','12 years in the making','The life of Mason, from early childhood to his arrival at college.','The life of Mason, from early childhood to his arrival at college.\r\n\r\nFilmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater\'s BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason\'s parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay\'s Yellow to Arcade Fire\'s Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.\r\n-\r\nIFC Films\r\n\r\nTwelve years in the less than nuclear life of a nuclear Texas family - father Mason, mother Olivia, oldest offspring Samantha, and youngest offspring Mason Jr. - is presented, focusing on the younger Mason\'s entire public school years, he sometimes referred to as MJ when in the presence of his father. This phase of their story begins in 2002 when Olivia and Mason, who originally married because she was pregnant, are now divorced, the marriage which was destined to dissolve due to these circumstances. Olivia has custody of the two children, and when he is around, Mason has weekend visitation rights, which has not happened in the last year or so as he stated he, an aspiring musician and somewhat irresponsible young adult, was \"away somewhere in Alaska\" trying to find himself. Olivia wants to eke out a better life for herself and the kids in a way that will also satisfy her own emotional needs. The two parents also try to move on with their sexual and relationship lives in the high probability that they will never reconcile, much against their children\'s own wants. MJ\'s growing up is affected by these circumstances and whatever the situation at the time outwardly orchestrated by Olivia (but often manipulated by others), and by his relationship with his family members - who evolve as they each grow up chronologically and emotionally - and others in his ever changing life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nA 12 year story of Mason the Younger, and his sister, Samantha lived a rough life with their mother, Olivia, divorced with their father, Mason. Mason is always giving them advices about living a simple life, when they were hanging out on the weekends. In their American-life journey, Mason Jr. must face the reality that his parents will never be together, started when his parents chose to marry again with other persons, and he must try to focus chasing his own career and achieving his dreams, step-by-step, even when the conditions are awful and full of ugly truths.\r\n-\r\nGusde\r\n\r\nRichard Linklater\'s Boyhood is a coming-of-age drama that the director spent twelve years making. He cast a young boy, Ellar Coltrane, and shot the film a few days at a time for over a decade so that he could capture how his leading actor, and the rest of his cast, aged. The film\'s story simply follows a boy named Mason (Coltrane) as he progresses from age 6 to 18 and deals with the typical travails of childhood like his parents\' divorce, bad stepparents, falling in love, finding his artistic voice, and fighting with his bratty older sister..\r\n\r\nThe joys and pitfalls of growing up are seen through the eyes of a child named Mason, his parents and his sister. Vignettes, filmed with the same cast over the course of 12 years, capture family meals, road trips, birthday parties, graduations and other important milestones. Songs from Coldplay, Arcade Fire and other artists capture the time period.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:47:52','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::7\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::7\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nThailand::13\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(77,'0206634','Children of Men','Children of Men','Children of Men\r\nNiños del hombre\r\nFilhos da Esperança\r\nДецата на хората\r\nLes fils de l\'homme\r\n人类之子\r\nDjeca čovječanstva\r\nPotomci lidí\r\nInimlapsed\r\nIhmisen pojat\r\nLes Fils de l\'homme\r\nTa paidia ton anthropon\r\nΤα παιδιά των ανθρώπων\r\nAz ember gyermeke\r\nI figli degli uomini\r\nTomorrow World\r\nトゥモロー・ワールド\r\nŽmoniu vaikai\r\nMenneskenes barn\r\nLudzkie dzieci\r\nOs Filhos do Homem\r\nCopiii omului\r\nCopiii tatălui\r\nДитя человеческое\r\nПотомци\r\nPotomkovia ludí\r\nOtroci clovestva\r\nHijos de los hombres\r\n人類之子\r\nSon umut\r\nДитя людське\r\nОстанній нащадок землі',2006,109,7.9,487485,'English\r\nGerman\r\nItalian\r\nRomanian\r\nSpanish\r\nArabic\r\nGeorgian\r\nRussian\r\nSerbian','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nJapan','Action\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Alfonso Cuarón','Alfonso Cuarón\r\nTimothy J.

In this dystopian world, humans have been incapable of reproducing for eighteen years for an unknown reason, meaning the imminent extinction of the species. Britain is the one remaining civilized society on the planet, which has resulted in people wanting to immigrate there. As such, it has become a police state in order to handle the immigrants, who are placed into refugee camps. Lowly government bureaucrat Theo Faron, once an activist, is approached by the Fishes, deemed a terrorist group, led by his ex-wife Julian Taylor, who he has not seen in close to twenty years, their marriage which disintegrated following the death of their infant son Dylan during the 2008 flu pandemic. Although the Fishes did use terrorist means in their on-going revolution against the state in the fight for immigrant rights, Julian vows that they now garner support solely by speaking to the people. What she wants is for Theo to use his connections to get transit papers for a young immigrant woman named Kee who needs to get to the coast. Although initially reluctant to do it because of the difficulty, Theo is able to grant Julian this favor, however with the change that he now needs to accompany Kee on her journey. As Theo and Kee progress on that journey, Theo learns more and more about what\'s going on, including the reason that Kee needs to get to the coast, the fact that no one in the group knows if their end destination even exists, and that his and Kee\'s lives are in greater danger than he believed when they started the journey. But Theo\'s sole mission becomes to help Kee at any cost for the survival of the species.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nThe world\'s youngest citizen has just died at the age of eighteen, and humankind is facing the likelihood of its own extinction.

In a climate of nationalistic violence, a London peace activist turned bureaucrat Theo Faron, joins forces with his revolutionary ex-wife Julian in order to save mankind by protecting a woman who has mysteriously became pregnant.\r\n-\r\nRyan Devlin\r\n\r\nThis movie envisages a world one generation from now that has fallen into chaos on the heels of an infertility defect in the population. The world\'s youngest citizen has just died at the age of eighteen, and humankind is facing the likelihood of its own extinction. Set against a backdrop of London torn apart by violence and warring nationalistic sects, this movie follows an unlikely champion of Earth\'s survival: Theo, a disillusioned ex-activist turned bureaucrat, who is forced to face his own demons and protect the planet\'s last remaining hope.\r\n\r\nWorld divisions, chaos and anarchy, these are the ways the world and the last remaining inhabitants are checking out. No child has been born for eighteen years. Human life and its moral self is eroding into extinction. Set in Britain in the year 2027, this is Theodore Faron finding his ghosts coming back to haunt his fruitless life, in the form of an underground band of rebels The Fishes. Unwittingly drawn into their plight, learning who can be trusted, who can be dependable, and how he must hold the most precious secret the Human race has been so longing to hear, the miracle that can change the course of Humanity; the first pregnant woman in eighteen years. On the run, he, Kee and Miriam must travel cross-country, on the run, terrified and helpless to the safe haven of the Human Project. With the help of aging hippie Jasper Palmer, this horrific, dark, unconventional, and uncompromising road movie is all that is left between the demise of the Human race and the birth of a new dawn.\r\n-\r\nCinema_Fan\r\n\r\nWith this dystopian world ravished by war, paranoia, and the frustrations of Man, the Orwellian vision of 1984, the totalitarian future is now complete and amongst us. With female fertility becoming obsolete, Man cannot reproduce, and no child has been born on the face of the Earth for eighteen years. Man, and his future, is dying. Soon he shall be extinct. Theo, the beaten, downtrodden and middle-aged ex-political activist will, unwittingly, become involved in a war of an underground revolt. Here, he is active once more, in the perilous journey across England\'s home counties, with a young girl, Kee, who, to Theo\'s bewilderment is pregnant. The first pregnant woman for more than eighteen years. This secret must be protected, at all cost, and mother and child must flee to the mysterious and enigmatic Human Project, across the seas. Their flight is a constant fight for survival. Who can be trusted?

Meanwhile in Hong Kong, London and in a small province, cases of the mystery illness are cropping up, as the American CDC and the World Health Organization give their best effort researching the virus. A race against the clock begins, as the virus is spreading in a geometric progression, and if no solution is found - very fast - humanity will cease to be.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nUnable to comprehend the sudden and untimely demise of his fit-as-a-fiddle wife, Beth, and his equally healthy son, Clark, suddenly, the grieving father, Mitch Emhoff, finds himself quarantined and in shock. In the meantime, as a virulent pathogen is infecting thousands around the globe, the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation struggle to figure out the origin and the rapid progress of the virus; but, in vain. Now, against the backdrop of an unprecedented situation and the hunt for Patient Zero, nothing makes sense, and what\'s even more dangerous, self-appointed prophets manipulate the masses, as riots erupt, economies collapse, and people perish by the thousands. But, the invisible adversary is everywhere, there\'s still no cure for the lethal disease, and more or less, the average person touches his face nearly 3,000 times a day. Is there an escape from the suffocating grip of the deadly contagion?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:49:48','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+',0),(79,'0278504','Insomnia','Insomnia','Insomnia\r\nNoches blancas (Insomnia)\r\nInsomnia - Schlaflos\r\nInsônia\r\nОпасно безсъние\r\nInsomnie\r\nNesanica\r\nUnetus\r\nÁlmatlanság\r\nインソムニア\r\nBezmiegs\r\nNemiga\r\nBezsenność\r\nInsónia\r\nБессонница\r\nНесаница\r\nInsomnio\r\n針鋒相對\r\nİnsomnia\r\nUykusuz\r\nБезсоння\r\nNoches blancas\r\nMất Ngủ',2002,118,7.2,288272,'English','United States','Drama\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Christopher Nolan','Hillary Seitz\r\nNikolaj Frobenius\r\nErik Skjoldbjærg','George Clooney\r\nBen Cosgrove\r\nBroderick Johnson\r\nPaul Junger Witt\r\nAndrew A.

In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional.

Watching him get his degree are his wealthy parents, Walt McCandless and Billie McCandless, and his teenaged sister, Carine McCandless. Before his parents and sister head home to Virginia following the convocation, Chris, refusing his parents\' gift of a new car to replace his old Datsun which he states works perfectly fine, tells them that he has thoughts of going into Harvard Law, he having received excellent grades in what were largely classes focusing on global social consciousness. Walt, Billie and Carine will learn by the end of the summer that Chris had no intention of going to Harvard as he has since moved from his apartment in Atlanta without a word to them, he arranging with the post office to hold his mail for a couple of months before being \"returned to sender\" to give him a head start in his escape from his family. Chris\' Datsun is eventually discovered abandoned in the Arizona desert, the authorities believing it being done on purpose as opposed to Chris being abducted. Walt and Billie intend to continue to search for Chris until they know conclusively what has happened to him. Carine, having had much the same upbringing as Chris, believes she understands what he is doing in making this escape. What he has done is either donated most of his money to Oxfam or burned it, and has destroyed all of his ID in an effort to start life anew as a child of the Earth, he rechristening himself Alexander Supertramp. This move is in rebellion to much of western society, and most specifically against the type of life his parents epitomize, they who he believes should never have gotten married and are hypocrites in portraying what they believe society expects of them, being generally unhappy with each other and life in the process. He ultimately wants to live off the land, carrying with him only what material possessions he will need, but wants to experience freedom by traveling the country by thumbing rides or riding the rails, working the odd job until he earns enough to purchase what he needs at any give time, and obtaining some skills he knows he will need to survive in the destination he has in mind when he is ready: the wilds of Alaska. Despite stating that he does not want or need attachments, he does make some human connections along the way, and not necessarily to/with like-minded people.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:53:21','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::7\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(81,'7286456','Joker','Joker','Joker\r\nXhoker\r\nGuasón\r\nCoringa\r\nЖокера\r\nXiao Chou\r\n小丑\r\nJokker\r\nジョーカー\r\nDžokers\r\nDžokeris\r\nEl Bromas\r\nДжокер\r\nЏокер',2019,122,8.4,1139765,'English','United States\r\nCanada','Crime\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Todd Phillips','Todd Phillips\r\nScott Silver\r\nBob Kane\r\nBill Finger\r\nJerry Robinson','Richard Baratta\r\nBruce Berman\r\nJason Cloth\r\nBradley Cooper\r\nJoseph Garner\r\nAaron L.

The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for the African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with The Negro Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America\'s racial segregation. Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America\'s appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other\'s talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nNew York City bouncer Frank \"Tony Lip\" Vallelonga is searching for new employment after his nightclub is closed for renovations, eventually landing an interview as a driver for \"Doc\" Don Shirley, a famed pianist. Their first encounter does not go well, as Tony\'s flippant, uncultured behavior clashes with Don\'s sophisticated, reserved demeanor. However, Don eventually hires Tony on the strength of others\' word, as he needs someone who can help him stay out of trouble during an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South. They embark with plans to return home on Christmas Eve. Tony is given a copy of the Green Book by Don\'s record studio: a guide for black travelers to find safe havens throughout the segregated South. They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading further south. Tony and Don clash over their differences, as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act properly, while Don is disgusted by Tony\'s habits. Regardless, Tony finds himself impressed with Don\'s talent on the piano, and increasingly disgusted by the discriminatory treatment the latter receives by the hosts when he is not on stage. After a bar incident leads to a group of white men threatening Don\'s life, Tony rescues him by threatening to pull a gun on them. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour.\r\n\r\nDr Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighbourhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn early-1960s openly and legally segregated America, two polar opposites--the distinguished and refined African-American classical pianist, Don Shirley, and the uncultivated Italian-American nightclub bouncer, Tony Vallelonga--are about to form an unlikely friendship. With New York\'s Copacabana Club being renovated, Don and his new problem-solver chauffeur embark on a lengthy two-month concert tour through the hostile Deep South, equipped only with a subtly tremendous talent, a serenely resilient dignity, and a little vert guide book for visitors--The Negro Motorist Green-Book. Before endless kilometres of unfriendly territory, a single man chooses the hard way for the sake of progress; however, can one person make a difference?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nOctober, 1962. Italian-American Bronx native Tony Vallelonga - long called Tony Lip by those that know him for being able to BS his way out of anything - largely uses that ability to BS, his street smarts and his fists to do his job in \"customer relations\" (i.e. a glorified bouncer) at the Copa, where he has to deal with well dressed toughs and thugs, albeit with a smile and often without they knowing that he is screwing them. Like most of his Italian-American friends and family, he is a working class bigot, as demonstrated by his actions concerning some black laborers who did work in his and his wife Dolores\' apartment. With the Copa closed for renovations until the new year, Tony has to find another job in the interim, he, without telling Dolores, pawning some of his valuables in the meantime to put food on their and their two adolescent sons\' table. When he is given the inside scoop on a job working for Dr. Don Shirley, he only did not know before meeting Dr. Shirley that the Dr. refers to his multiple Ph.D.s, and that he is a classically trained pianist (the head of the popular music playing Don Shirley Trio) instead of a physician, but arguably most importantly that he is a well educated, wealthy and refined black man. The job is not only as chauffeur as Tony initially thought, but to be his all-expenses and well paid general foot soldier, especially in the area of security, for the eight week tour he has arranged for the trio with his record label, much of that tour in the Deep South (the last scheduled date being December 23rd in Birmingham, Alabama) hence the need for especially that security in he being black. Renegotiating the terms, learning that Dr. Shirley actually recruited him based on his reputation for being able to get the job done, and getting the okay from Dolores in the stipulation that he make it home for Christmas or else, Tony accepts the job. Beyond the obvious hazards of the race relations aspect of the job once they get to the Deep South, they will not only have to get over their own differences as humans in their moral and ethical values to survive with each other for eight weeks, but deal with the general role reversal of the uneducated white man being subservient to the well-educated black man. In that aspect, Dr. Shirley may have other issues in the Deep South as not fitting into either the white or black populations in general.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 11:55:24','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::12\r\nBulgaria::C\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nColombia::7\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::7\r\nEcuador::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::6\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::9\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::13\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(84,'1972591','King Arthur: Legend of the Sword','King Arthur: Legend of the Sword','King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\r\nEl Rey Arturo: La Leyenda de la Espada\r\nKralj Artur: Legenda o macu\r\nRei Arthur: A Lenda da Espada\r\nКрал Артур: Легенда за меча\r\nLe roi Arthur - La légende d\'Excalibur\r\nEl Rey Artuto: La Leyenda de la Espada\r\nKralj Arthur: Legenda o maču\r\nKong Arthur: Legenden om sværdet\r\nKuningas Arthur: Mõõga legend\r\nLe Roi Arthur : La Légende d\'Excalibur\r\nLe Roi Arthur : Le Pouvoir d\'Excalibur\r\nΒασιλιάς Αρθούρος: Ο θρύλος του σπαθιού\r\nArthur király: A kard legendája\r\nKing Arthur\r\nKing Arthur - Il potere della spada\r\nキング・アーサー\r\nKaralis Arturs.

But once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not.\r\n\r\nAn alternative version of the King Arthur legend. As a boy, Arthur is left orphaned after his father, King Uther Pendragon, and mother are killed in a war waged against them by Vortigern, who then assumes the throne. Arthur flees and is raised in a brothel, knowing very little of his birthright. Vortigern wants Arthur dead, to ensure there is no claimant to the throne. The legends foretell that only the next king will be able to draw Excalibur, Uther\'s sword, from the rock where it is lodged. So, in an effort to identify Arthur, Vortigern forces all the young men of Arthur\'s age to attempt to draw out the sword. Now it is Arthur\'s turn.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nMordred, an iron-fist-ed warlock, and his armies lay siege to Camelot, seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding mag-es over humankind. Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordred\'s lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther\'s treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uther\'s wife Igraine and slays Uther in combat. The only survivor is Uther\'s son Arthur, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium..\r\n\r\nStruggling to eke out an existence in Londinium\'s squalid and perilous streets, the orphaned young fighter and Uther Pendragon\'s only son, Arthur, is utterly oblivious to the fact that he is England\'s rightful ruler. Nearly two decades after his traitorous uncle, Vortigern, usurped the throne, Arthur is now the only one who can pull out from the magical boulder the legendary and long-lost blade of Excalibur; however, Vortigern is hell-bent on identifying him, and then, stopping him.

A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem, he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian\'s father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin Ayubi. But Baldwin\'s days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin\'s vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history.\r\n-\r\nSujit R. Varma\r\n\r\nIn 1184, French village blacksmith Balian just lost his wife through suicide grief-stricken by their child\'s death; the crusader Lord Godfrey, Baron of Ibelin, reveals himself as Balian\'s father and offers him a crusader life, which the youngster spontaneously rejects but after the local priest taunts him \'till his sword strikes fatally accepts, fleeing the French bishop\'s bloody justice and seeking divine forgiveness as promised to crusaders in Jerusalem. On the way, Balian is instructed the skills of war and chivalric honor code and dubbed a knight in Messina by his father, who was fatally wounded fighting off the bishop\'s men. After shipwreck on the Levantine coast, Balian soon proves himself a superior knight as fighter and noble idealist in the loyal service of leper King Baldwin, whose pragmatic right hand, the Count of Tiberias, fails to convince Balian the ruthless knight Reynald de Chatillon and his traitorous master, candidate-heir to the throne Guy de Lusignan, must be stopped by all means before they plunge the crusader kingdom in a fatal war against the noble, militarily far superior Saracen King Saladin. When Tiberias is proven right, he leaves for Cyprus, brave Balian stays to defend besieged Jerusalem against impossible odds.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:05:37','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nFinland::K-16/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',18),(86,'0240772','Ocean\'s Eleven','Ocean\'s Eleven','Ocean\'s Eleven\r\nLa gran estafa\r\nOnze Homens e um Segredo\r\nБандата на Оушън\r\nL\'inconnu de Las Vegas\r\n十一罗汉\r\nOceanovih jedanaest\r\nDannyho parťáci\r\nOceani 11 - kõrged panused\r\nOcean\'s Eleven - korkeat panokset\r\nKorkeat panokset\r\nOcean\'s eleven - Faites vos jeux!\r\nI symmoria ton enteka\r\nΗ συμμορία των έντεκα\r\n盜海豪情\r\nOcean\'s Eleven - Tripla vagy semmi\r\nYazdah yar-e Ocean\r\nOcean\'s Eleven - Fate il vostro gioco\r\nオーシャンズ11\r\nOušena banda\r\nOušeno vienuoliktukas\r\nOcean\'s Eleven: Ryzykowna gra\r\nOcean\'s Eleven - Façam as Vossas Apostas\r\nOcean\'s Eleven - Faceti jocurile\r\nОдиннадцать друзей Оушена\r\nИграј своју игру\r\nОушнових 11\r\nOcean\'s Eleven: Dannyho jedenástka\r\nDannyho jedenástka\r\nIgraj svojo igro\r\nOcean\'s Eleven: Hagan juego\r\nStorslam i Las Vegas\r\n瞞天過海\r\nOcean\'s 11\r\nОдинадцять друзів Оушена\r\nO11\r\n11\r\nOushenning 11 do\'sti\r\n11 Tên Cướp Thế Kỷ',2001,116,7.7,550543,'English\r\nItalian\r\nCantonese','United States','Crime\r\nThriller','Steven Soderbergh','George Clayton Johnson\r\nJack Golden Russell\r\nHarry Brown\r\nCharles Lederer\r\nTed Griffin','Bruce Berman\r\nSusan Ekins\r\nJohn Hardy\r\nR.J.

It\'s not going to be easy, as they plan to get in secretly and out with $150 million.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nRecently paroled con artist Danny Ocean is a man who keeps his cool in situations unlikely to make any individual comfortable. No sooner does he violate his parole that he\'s traveling around the country gathering people for his next big scheme: to rob three casinos owned by the ever ruthless Terry Benedict. With the aid of a right hand man named Rusty, a thief out of retirement, a pickpocket, a card dealer, a surveillance man, a Chinese acrobat, an explosives expert, two frontmen, and a bitter casino mogul, they make up Ocean\'s eleven, out to make one very big score.\r\n-\r\nMonkeyKingMA\r\n\r\nDanny Ocean is a thief who has just been paroled from prison.

So they recruit nine guys and they begin to put Ocean\'s plan in motion. Everything is going well until Rusty discovers that Ocean\'s ex-wife, Tess is the main squeeze of Terry Benedict the (ruthless) owner of the casinos. Rusty asks him what is he going to do if he has to choose.

The ninth film from the writer-director features a large ensemble cast and multiple storylines in a tribute to the final moments of Hollywood\'s golden age.\r\n\r\n1969. Rick Dalton was once the star of a highly popular TV series but a few bad choices have set his career back, leaving him wondering if he should quit showbiz altogether. His best friend is Cliff Booth, an aging stuntman who was Dalton\'s stunt-double in movies and TV. His career is largely over. While Booth ekes out an existence, Dalton still lives a life of relative luxury in Hollywood, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. In fact, his neighbours are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nSet in Los Angeles, 1969. Over the hill TV actor, Rick Dalton, and his best friend and stunt-double, Cliff Booth, strive to reignite their careers as their failure is juxtaposed with the success of Rick\'s new next door neighbours: Sharon Tate Tate and Roman Polanski Rick and Cliff become unwittingly entangled with the infamous Manson family in the process.\r\n-\r\njmcrighton-892-694446\r\n\r\nAfter a meteoric five-year rise to the top in the cut-throat world of dazzling Hollywood and a long decade of treading water, the once-young-and-popular action star, Rick Dalton, finds it difficult to swallow that the rapacious and always hungry for new blood film industry can do without him. Sensing that his career may be nearing its end, Rick along with his sympathetic confidant and former stunt double, Cliff Booth, face the grim possibility of a mundane new life in an ever-changing 1969 Los Angeles. Now, unlike his glamorous next-door neighbours--the young director fresh off the triumphant success of Rosemary\'s Baby (1968), Roman Polanski, and the rising star of The Wrecking Crew (1968), Sharon Tate--Rick has to make a difficult decision. Of course, none of them is aware that their fates, and their very lives, are on a collision course with a certain Charles Manson, and his army of ferociously zealous believers. Will Hollywood ever be the same after August 9, 1969?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nActor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn\'t recognize anymore. He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate -- the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:30:13','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nBulgaria::D\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEcuador::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::A-18\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMalta::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C18',18),(88,'1121096','Seventh Son','Seventh Son','Seventh Son\r\nEl séptimo hijo\r\nYeddinci Ogul\r\nO Sétimo Filho\r\nСедмият син\r\nLe septième fils\r\nThe Seventh Son\r\nSedmi sin\r\nSedmý syn\r\nSeitsmes poeg\r\nDer siebte Sohn\r\nΈβδομος Γιος\r\nA hetedik fiú\r\nHa\'ben ha\'shvi\'i\r\nIl settimo figlio\r\nセブンス・サン 魔使いの弟子\r\nSeptītais dēls\r\nSeptintasis sūnus\r\nSeventh Son - Den siste lærling\r\nStracharz\r\nSiódmy syn\r\nAl saptelea fiu\r\nСедьмой сын\r\nSiedmy syn\r\n第七傳人\r\nYedinci Oğul\r\nСьомий син\r\nThe Spook\'s Apprentice\r\nThe Wardstone Chronicles\r\nDua Con Thu 7',2014,102,5.5,75341,'English','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nCanada\r\nChina','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFantasy','Sergei Bodrov','Charles Leavitt\r\nSteven Knight\r\nMatt Greenberg\r\nJoseph Delaney','Maguy R.

The only catch is can only be there for 8 minutes at any given time. That morning, a bomb exploded on a commuter train just outside Chicago. He occupies the body of teacher going to work on that train and is confused as to what he is doing or why he is there as his last memory is of flying his helicopter on a combat mission in Afghanistan. Those in charge of the program explain to him that there is a bomb on the train, and that he must locate it. More importantly, he must identify the bomber as another bombing is expected later that day. He is also told however that he cannot change the past and can only gather information. As he develops a liking for his traveling companion Christina, he sets out to test that theory.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nA man, believing that he is Captain Colter Stevens, awakens at 07:40 on a commuter train bound for Chicago, feeling agitated as he has no idea how he got there since he believes he should be in Afghanistan in his job as a military helicopter pilot. What\'s more, he is sitting across from a woman who knows him as teacher Sean Fentress. Looking in a mirror and checking his wallet for ID, he sees that he has indeed assumed Fentress\' body. Exactly eight minutes after he woke up and just as the train enters Chicago, a massive bomb explodes on the train killing everyone aboard. Next he knows, he is again Captain Colter Stevens, is strapped into a chair in a capsule, and is communicating via video link to Captain Goodwin, who reminds him that he is working on an experimental project, code named Beleaguered Castle. His current mission is to find the bomb aboard the train so that he can discover the identity of the bomber. He will be sent back to the time he awoke as Sean Fentress again and again only for those eight minutes, each time gathering more information until he discovers the bomber\'s identity. As he reluctantly works on this mission - reluctant in that he still believes he should be in Afghanistan - he tries to find out the underlying reason for the project, since he will learn that all aboard the train have died and will regardless, and why he was chosen for the project. As he finds out more and more, he has his own missions which may be contrary to what Goodwin and the project\'s architect, Rutledge, have in mind.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal headlines this Sci-Fi time-travel thriller directed by Moon\'s Duncan Jones from a script by Ben Ripley and Billy Ray. A bomb explodes on a Chicago train, derailing the locomotive and killing hundreds. In an attempt to identify the bomber and prevent another, larger attack on downtown Chicago, Captain Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) agrees to take part in a clandestine government experiment dubbed \"Source Code,\" which allows him to enter the body of a male passenger during the eight minutes before the man is killed. But during his first trip back, Capt. Stevens fails to gather enough clues to prevent the second attack. With time quickly running out, he repeats the mission in a desperate race to head off one of the most deadly terrorist attacks ever to take place on American soil.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:31:50','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nCzechia::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13',12),(90,'0936501','Taken','Taken','Taken\r\nBúsqueda implacable\r\nBusca Implacável\r\nТвърде лично\r\nL\'Enlèvement\r\n飓风营救\r\n96 sati\r\n96 Hodin\r\nRöövitud\r\n96 Hours\r\n96 Hours - Taken\r\nI arpagi\r\nΗ αρπαγή\r\n救參96小時\r\nElrabolva\r\nIo vi troverò\r\nTaken - Io vi troverò\r\n96-jikan\r\n96時間\r\nNolaupītā\r\nPagrobimas\r\nUprowadzona\r\nTeroare in Paris\r\nЗаложница\r\nОтета\r\n96 сати\r\n96 hodín\r\nUgrabljena\r\nVenganza\r\n即刻救援\r\n96 saat\r\nВикрадена\r\nGarovdagi qiz\r\nCưỡng Đoạt',2008,90,7.8,588402,'English\r\nFrench\r\nAlbanian\r\nArabic','France\r\nUnited States\r\nUnited Kingdom','Action\r\nCrime\r\nThriller','Pierre Morel','Luc Besson\r\nRobert Mark Kamen','Luc Besson\r\nDidier Hoarau\r\nFranck Lebreton\r\nMichael Mandaville','Nathaniel Méchaly','Liam Neeson\r\nMaggie Grace\r\nLeland Orser\r\nJon Gries\r\nDavid Warshofsky\r\nHolly Valance\r\nKatie Cassidy\r\nXander Berkeley\r\nOlivier Rabourdin\r\nGérard Watkins\r\nFamke Janssen\r\nMarc Amyot\r\nArben Bajraktaraj\r\nRadivoje Bukvic\r\nMathieu Busson\r\nMichel Flash\r\nNicolas Giraud\r\nRubens Hyka\r\nCamille Japy\r\nValentin Kalaj\r\nFani Kolarova\r\nGoran Kostic\r\nChristophe Kourotchkine\r\nEdwin Krüger\r\nJalil Naciri\r\nAnca Radici\r\nNathan Rippy\r\nHéléna Soubeyrand\r\nTommy Spahija\r\nAnatole Taubman\r\nBertrand Treuil\r\nOpender Singh\r\nChristy Reese\r\nGeorge Hertzberg\r\nNabil Massad\r\nIvette González\r\nThierry Stein\r\nDon Abernathy\r\nWhitney Adams\r\nAffif Ben Badra\r\nSophie Chamoux\r\nMichael Finn\r\nDan Flood\r\nKatrina Forrest\r\nJean-Yves Freyburger\r\nStephen Janousek\r\nAlexandra Kedzierska\r\nAlban Lenoir\r\nMylène Ragon\r\nChristina Alice Schmidt\r\nTamara Witmer','They took his daughter.

Centred around the Grape family Ellen and Amy and their two brothers Arnie and Gilbert, who, along with their morbidly obese widowed mother Bonnie Grape are striving to survive and coexist with the absence of a father figure, low wage work and seventeen-year-old Arnie\'s severe mental condition. It is in this awkward and extremely one sided affair that the unfortunate Gilbert has to constantly, while working for the town\'s slowly dying convenience store, take care of his younger brother Arnie. Gilbert\'s life, his future, is thwarted he knows this, but it is in this guardian angel that his love and bond for Arnie cannot, and will not, be let go. That is until the free spirit of Becky arrives in town, and with her grandmother are stranded for the week while waiting for parts for their vehicle. This realization unties new feelings, new thoughts and new hope for the put upon Gibert, something new is eating Gilbert Grape.\r\n-\r\nCinema_Fan\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t much for Gilbert to look forward to in the small, dying town of Endora. The only thing keeping him sane is his mentally-challenged brother, and his physically-challenged mother. Despite the challenges that are posed in this small town, Gilbert had forgotten that he has become challenged himself and, with the help of a marooned world traveler, begins to see the bigger picture.\r\n-\r\nMal Fee Zants\r\n\r\nSwedish director Lasse Hallstrom\'s follow-up to the underrated Once Around earned far more attention than its predecessor thanks to the judicious casting of perennial thinking woman\'s heartthrob Johnny Depp and a certain up-and-coming thespian by the name of Leonardo DiCaprio. A prisoner of his dysfunctional family\'s broken dreams in tiny Endora, IA, Gilbert (Depp) serves as breadwinner and caretaker for his mother and siblings following his father\'s suicide and his older brother\'s defection. Momma (Darlene Cates) is a morbidly obese shut-in who hasn\'t left the house in seven years; her children include Arnie (DiCaprio), who\'s about to turn 18 despite a host of negative medical forecasts, and terminally embarrassed Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), who\'s emerging from an awkward adolescence. When he\'s not taking care of the difficult but tender Arnie, Gilbert spends his time fixing up the family\'s tattered farmhouse, working at a failing mom-and-pop grocery store and hanging with local misfits Bobby (Crispin Glover), an overly ambitious junior undertaker, and Tucker (John C. Reilly), a handyman who hankers after a job at the new burger franchise. Into this complicated but essentially unchanging social universe steps Becky (Juliette Lewis), a thoughtful young woman who\'s been escorting her nomadic grandmother from state to state in a mobile-home caravan. As Becky teaches Gilbert to finally consider his own happiness for a change, she disrupts both his family obligations and his long-running affair with a lonely housewife (Mary Steenburgen).\r\n\r\nThis film tells a story about Gilbert Grape. He is a grocery store worker who is burdened by his family\'s needs. He cares and provides for a intellectually disabled young adult brother and a morbidly obese mother. The Grape household has deteriorated since the suicide of their father and Gilbert bares the weight (no pun intended) of a struggling poor American family. In this tale, Gilbert has a string of risky affairs which complicates matters. This movie tells a more realistic version of the trials and tribulations of barely functioning family in the mid-west of America.\r\n\r\nGilbert Grape lives in Endora, a place where nothing much happens. The only times the police get something to do is when Gilbert\'s autistic brother Arnie tries to climb up on the watertower nearby. Taking care of Arnie is mostly Gilbert\'s task which can be pretty demanding, at least while you are working at the local grocery store. Then one day Becky and her grandmother pass through Endora getting trouble with the car. Gilbert falls in love with Becky, but gets problems when he tries to find time for his own private life.\r\n-\r\nLars J.

Things begin to get complicated when one of the crew members falls in love with Claire.\r\n\r\nThe Charlestown neighborhood of Boston is renowned for churning out a high number of armed robbers, generation after generation. These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert \'Gloansy\' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug\'s mother ran off and Doug\'s father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James\' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she\'s told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI\'s lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn Boston\'s bleak Charlestown, criminals depend on a code of silence: those caught serve their time. Doug MacRay masterminds bank robberies with three friends: the hotheaded Jem; Des, an electrician; and Al, their driver. After a dicey bank job, Doug must make sure the female bank manager, Claire, who lives in Charlestown, hasn\'t recognized any of the crew. He contrives to meet her, finds out she doesn\'t know any of the crew and, in the process, finds her appealing. As the FBI zeroes in on the gang, Doug wants out of the crew, but Jem and their money launderer, an aging florist, insist that Doug do one more job. Are prison and death the only ways out of Charlestown?\r\n-\r\n\r\nAfter the heist of the Cambridge Merchants Bank, the four thieves blindfold and kidnap the manager Claire Keesey. They take her driver license; release her at an empty beach; and head to Charlestown, Boston. Later, the friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert \'Gloansy\' Magloan and Desmond Elden find that Claire also lives in Charlestown and they decide to monitor her steps. Doug MacRay gets close to Claire to know what she might have told to the FBI and they fall in love with each other. Meanwhile, the FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley is assigned to investigate the heists to armored trucks and banks in Charlestown and he concludes that the thieves are the four friends. He joins his team and keeps Doug and his friends under surveillance. Doug decides to move to Florida with Claire and begin a new life; however, the dwellers are trapped in Charlestown and they do not have any way out but dead.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug\'s crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they\'re also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug\'s fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn\'t suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug\'s true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he\'s ever known.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:38:53','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(95,'3659388','The Martian','Martian','The Martian\r\nMarsiani\r\nMisión Rescate\r\nPerdido em Marte\r\nМарсианецът\r\nSeul sur Mars\r\nMarsovac\r\nMarťan\r\nMarslane\r\nYksin Marsissa\r\nDer Marsianer: Rettet Mark Watney\r\nΗ διάσωση\r\n火星任務\r\nMentőexpedíció\r\nLehatzil et Mark Watney\r\nSopravvissuto - The Martian\r\nOdyssey\r\nオデッセイ\r\nMarsietis\r\nThe Martian - Strandet på Mars\r\nMarsjanin\r\nMarsjanin 3D\r\nMarțianul\r\nМарсианин\r\nМарсовац: Спасилачка мисија\r\nMarsovec\r\nMarte (The Martian)\r\n絕地救援\r\nKu-Tai 140 Lan-Mai\r\nMarslı\r\nМарсіянин\r\nThe Martian 3D\r\nMisión rescate\r\nMarslik\r\nNgười Về Từ Sao Hỏa',2015,144,8,815788,'English\r\nMandarin','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nHungary\r\nJordan','Adventure\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi','Ridley Scott','Drew Goddard\r\nAndy Weir','Howard Ellis\r\nDrew Goddard\r\nAdam Goodman\r\nMark Huffam\r\nTeresa Kelly\r\nSimon Kinberg\r\nMichael Schaefer\r\nRidley Scott\r\nAditya Sood','Harry Gregson-Williams','Matt Damon\r\nJessica Chastain\r\nKristen Wiig\r\nJeff Daniels\r\nMichael Peña\r\nSean Bean\r\nKate Mara\r\nSebastian Stan\r\nAksel Hennie\r\nChiwetel Ejiofor\r\nBenedict Wong\r\nMackenzie Davis\r\nDonald Glover\r\nNick Mohammed\r\nShu Chen\r\nEddy Ko\r\nEnzo Cilenti\r\nJonathan Aris\r\nGruffudd Glyn\r\nGeoffrey Thomas\r\nYang Haiwen\r\nTsogtsaikan Narantsogt\r\nBrian Caspe\r\nMatt Devere\r\nMike Kelly\r\nSzonja Oroszlán\r\nGreg De Cuir\r\nMark O\'Neal\r\nPeter Linka\r\nDeclan Hannigan\r\nPeter Schueller\r\nWaleska Latorre\r\nFrederik Pleitgen\r\nNikolett Barabas\r\nKaren Gagnon\r\nLili Bordán\r\nCharlie Gardner\r\nNóra Hörich\r\nKamilla Fátyol\r\nYang Liu\r\nXue Xuxing\r\nRichard Rifkin\r\nNick Wittman\r\nBalázs Medveczky\r\nBen O\'Brien\r\nScott Alexander Young\r\nJason Ryan\r\nJames Dougherty\r\nIrén Bordán\r\nDilyana Bouklieva\r\nDora Endre\r\nBjörn Freiberg\r\nJames Fred Harkins Jr.\r\nMinouche Kaftel\r\nGayathri Kasupathipillai\r\nViktor Mitev\r\nArnold Montey\r\nTom Nguyen\r\nTamás Sebe\r\nSam Spruell\r\nNorbert Szekeres\r\nDominika Szosznyák\r\nLara Ilona Thompson\r\nBalázs Veres\r\nHenry Winkler\r\nTakács Zalán','Bring Him Home\r\n\r\nHelp is only 140 million miles away','An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assume him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive and can survive until a potential rescue.','An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assume him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive and can survive until a potential rescue.\r\n\r\nDuring a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring \"the Martian\" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney\'s safe return.\r\n-\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\nDuring their mission in Mars, a team of astronauts is hit by an unpredicted storm and have to abort their mission and leave for Earth. During the evacuation one of the crew members, Mark Watney, is hit by a projectile due to the storm and is thrown away. The crew is forced to leave him thinking he died due to rupture in his space suit. However Mark survives and now has to find ingenious ways to make it till the next scheduled Mars mission fours years later with the remaining meagre supplies. Being a botanist he manages to cultivate food and survives by scavenging parts of previous missions. NASA soon learns about him and attempts a daring and dangerous mission to bring him back. Will they succeed in bringing him back alive? Only time will tell.\r\n-\r\nKeith Francis\r\n\r\nAfter an exploratory mission goes awry, lone astronaut Mark Watney is left for dead on the hostile surface of Mars and must use his scientific ingenuity to homestead an enclosed habitat where he can survive. Meanwhile, the astronauts he left behind realize the severity of his plight and join forces with an international coalition of scientists to launch a rescue mission in defiance of NASA protocol..\r\n\r\nIn a not-so-distant 2035, the intrepid crew of the Ares III expedition safely lands on the arid red landscape of the distant planet Mars. However, when a sudden space-storm forces them to abort the ambitious mission, the injured botanist, Mark Watney, finds himself marooned on the Red Planet, left for dead by friends and colleagues. All alone on a lifeless rock--140 million miles away from Earth, and in the face of limited resources--the stranded astronaut must do everything in his power to survive, as unexpected satellite photos prove that Mark is still alive.

As conflict erupts in the kingdoms of men, an ancient enemy rises once again to threaten them all. Meanwhile, the last heirs of a recently usurped dynasty plot to take back their homeland from across the Narrow Sea.\r\n-\r\nSam Gray\r\n\r\nYears after a rebellion spurred by a stolen bride to be and the blind ambitions of a mad King, Robert of the house Baratheon (Mark Addy) sits on the much desired Iron Throne. In the mythical land of Westeros, nine noble families fight for every inch of control and every drop of power. The King\'s Hand, Jon Arryn (Sir John Standing), is dead. And Robert seeks out his only other ally in all of Westeros, his childhood friend Lord Eddard \"Ned\" Stark. The solemn and honorable Warden of the North is tasked to depart his frozen sanctuary and join the King in the capital of King\'s Landing to help the now overweight and drunk Robert rule. However, a letter in the dead of night informs \"Ned\" that the former Hand was murdered, and that Robert will be next. So noble Ned goes against his better desires in an attempt to save his friend and the kingdoms. But political intrigue, plots, murders, and sexual desires lead to a secret that could tear the Seven Kingdoms apart. And soon Eddard will find out what happens when you play the Game of Thrones.\r\n-\r\nGregory Tobin\r\n\r\nBased on the best-selling book series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George R.R. Martin, this sprawling HBO drama is set in a world where summers span several decades and winters can last a lifetime. From the scheming south and the savage eastern lands, to the frozen north and ancient Wall that protects the realm from the mysterious darkness beyond, the powerful families of the Seven Kingdoms are locked in a battle for the Iron Throne. This is a story of duplicity and treachery, nobility and honor, conquest and triumph. In the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nIn the mythical continent of Westeros, nine families of higher nobility (Targaryen, Lannisters, Starks, Tyrell, Martell, Greyjoys, Baratheons and Boltons) scramble bitterly to gain power over the seven kingdoms and the Iron throne. As Westeros becomes rife with political unrests, conflicts, treachery, murder and debauchery, an ancient enemy (Army of the dead) awakens and strike the sense of doom to the living folks of Westeros.\r\n-\r\nmwitamaibuni\r\n\r\nNine noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy), King of Westeros, asks his old friend, Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean), to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order of business to investigate further. Meanwhile, Queen Cersei Lannister\'s family may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, Tyrell, and Martell leads to full-scale war. All while an ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night\'s Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.\r\n-\r\nTfilm78 and Cajunman','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:40:53','','','','','',1,8,1,'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::18\r\nColombia::18\r\nCzechia::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::TV-MA',18),(97,'2306299','Vikings','Vikings','Vikings\r\nVikingos\r\nВикинги\r\nVikinzi\r\nVikingové\r\nViikingid\r\nViikingit\r\nΒίκινγκ\r\nVikingek\r\nヴァイキング ～海の覇者たち～\r\nVikingi\r\nVikingai\r\nWikingowie\r\nVikingii\r\nВикинзи\r\nVikingovia\r\n維京傳奇\r\nVikingler\r\nВікінги\r\nVikinglar\r\nHuyen Thoai Vikings',2013,44,8.5,491670,'English\r\nOld English\r\nNorse, Old\r\nLatin\r\nFrench\r\nArabic\r\nGreek, Ancient (to 1453)\r\nRussian','Ireland\r\nCanada','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nDrama\r\nHistory\r\nRomance\r\nWar','Ciaran Donnelly\r\nKen Girotti\r\nSteve Saint Leger\r\nJeff Woolnough\r\nHelen Shaver\r\nDaniel Grou\r\nDavid Frazee\r\nJoshua Zimmerman\r\nDavid Wellington\r\nJohan Renck\r\nKari Skogland\r\nKelly Makin\r\nSarah Harding\r\nBen Bolt\r\nPaddy Breathnach\r\nAnthony Karkosza\r\nKarla Braun\r\nKatheryn Winnick','Michael Hirst\r\nMichael Hirst\r\nMichael Hirst\r\nJustin Pollard\r\nJustin Pollard','Michael Hirst\r\nSheila Hockin\r\nJames Flynn\r\nBill Goddard\r\nSherry Marsh\r\nSeamus McInerney\r\nMorgan O\'Sullivan\r\nJohn Weber\r\nAlan Gasmer\r\nJustin Pollard\r\nBreda Walsh\r\nKeith Thompson\r\nDonal Geraghty\r\nSteve Wakefield\r\nLiz Gill\r\nArturo Interian\r\nSanne Wohlenberg\r\nAndrew Burke\r\nSteven Daly\r\nZakaria Alaoui\r\nArni Hansson','Trevor Morris','Katheryn Winnick\r\nGustaf Skarsgård\r\nAlexander Ludwig\r\nGeorgia Hirst\r\nAlex Høgh Andersen\r\nJordan Patrick Smith\r\nMarco Ilsø\r\nPeter Franzén\r\nTravis Fimmel\r\nClive Standen\r\nJohn Kavanagh\r\nJennie Jacques\r\nMaude Hirst\r\nMoe Dunford\r\nAlyssa Sutherland\r\nLinus Roache\r\nGeorge Blagden\r\nAdam Copeland\r\nJessalyn Gilsig\r\nJasper Pääkkönen\r\nRagga Ragnars\r\nFerdia Walsh-Peelo\r\nEdvin Endre\r\nKatie Castle\r\nAlicia Agneson\r\nIda Nielsen\r\nJefferson Hall\r\nPhilip O\'Sullivan\r\nLucy Martin\r\nJosefin Asplund\r\nKelly Campbell\r\nScott Graham\r\nJonathan Rhys Meyers\r\nMorgane Polanski\r\nDanila Kozlovskiy\r\nEric Johnson\r\nCormac Melia\r\nHuw Parmenter\r\nDarren Cahill\r\nOran Glynn O\'Donovan\r\nRyan Henson\r\nBen Robson\r\nAmy Bailey\r\nNathan O\'Toole\r\nGaia Weiss\r\nLothaire Bluteau\r\nCathal O\'Hallin\r\nDonal Logue\r\nSteven Berkoff\r\nIvan Kaye\r\nOwen Roe\r\nDavid Lindström\r\nLeah McNamara\r\nKaren Hassan\r\nCeline Nihicidhe\r\nRay Stevenson\r\nKris Holden-Ried\r\nRoisin Murphy\r\nKristy Dawn Dinsmore\r\nElodie Curry\r\nJack McEvoy\r\nRuby O\'Leary\r\nAmy Donnelly\r\nKieran O\'Reilly\r\nDonna Dent\r\nElijah Rowen\r\nFrankie McCafferty\r\nThorbjørn Harr\r\nBen Roe\r\nMei Bignall\r\nTadhg Murphy\r\nDean Ridge\r\nJonathan Delaney Tynan\r\nSvea Killoran\r\nStephen Rockett\r\nLuke Shanahan\r\nChris McHallem\r\nElijah O\'Sullivan\r\nLulubelle Earley\r\nEimear O\'Grady\r\nLenn Kudrjawizki\r\nDianne Doan\r\nNoella Brennan\r\nSteve Wall\r\nNiall Ó Sioradáin\r\nJames Quinn Markey\r\nElinor Crawley\r\nGabriel Byrne\r\nDavid Pearse\r\nKevin Durand\r\nDiarmaid Murtagh\r\nAndrei Claude\r\nSeán T.

He prevents killing the human-demonic half-blood, which was accidentally created and raises this \"Hellboy\", while rising to head of a secret C.I.A.-linked U.S. agency Bureau of Paranormal Research, which secretly studies and uses the occult, including supernatural freaks. As \"father\" Broom is aging, he hand-picks brilliant, sensitive Agent John Myers as new minder-companion, as regular \"warrior\" Agent Clay can\'t empathize and lacks flexibility mental. Hellboy is quite a handful, regularly spotted by worried civilians on unauthorized excursions, especially to pyro-telekinetic freak friend in a mental asylum. Johnny, Hellboy, and Clay team up on missions against paranormal threats with aquatic-bionic freak Abe Sapien. Their task proves to be daunting, as monster Sammael multiplies every time it \"dies\", while Rasputin and the Nazis reemerge, armed for revenge.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nSpawned in the fiery pits of Hell, humankind\'s unlikely defender--the scarlet-skinned, cigar-chomping, gun-toting, hornless demon with the heart of a human, Hellboy--finds himself battling the same evil forces, nearly sixty years after thwarting Adolf Hitler\'s occult scheme in 1944. As a special member of the top-secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, led by his father-figure, Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy along with his equally exotic brothers-in-arms--the telepathic amphibious man, Abe Sapiens, and the beautiful fire-starter, Liz Sherman--join forces with the FBI agent, John Myers, to avert the plans of the sinister Russian mystic, Grigory Rasputin. Once more, the world\'s future is at stake. Can Hellboy, the infernal hero, save the day?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nHellboy isn\'t your average hero. Hell, he isn\'t even your average superhero. Brought forth by the Nazis during a sacred ritual towards the end of World War II. Our hero was summoned by accident when the evil monk of Russian history and folklore, Grigori Rasputin was meddling with forces that lead to his undoing. With the twisted and evil monster trapped for another sixty years when things don\'t go as planned (U.S. soldiers heroically intervened). Hellboy is raised by Professor Trevor \"Broom\" Bruttenholm, an expert in the occult. Our demonic hero is initiated in to the Bureau of Paranormal Research, were he joins the amphibious, kind-hearted, and clever fellow \"freak\", Abe Sapien. When Rasputin returns once again with the aid of his minions, the maniacal, undead assassin Kroenen and the monk\'s faithful lover Ilsa. Hellboy must unwillingly pair up with John Myers, an idealistic, naive new Agent of the Bureau. Not only that, but the big hunk of an evil basher becomes entangled in a love triangle with the pyro-telekinetic love of his life Liz and his new comrade. Fighting evil couldn\'t prove to be more difficult, or out there.\r\n-\r\nrobert-filmfan(robert@mcelwaines.fsnet.co.uk)\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazis attempt to use black magic during the last days of World War II, a monkey-like demon is thrown into the real world. Trevor \"Broom\" Bruttenholm discovers the creature and rescues it from any danger. The creature grows up and goes by the name of \"Hellboy\". Working in secrecy, Hellboy works to rid any evil. When some familiar faces from the past appear, it\'s going to take more than Hellboy to stop them.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUk','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:48:22','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::18+\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzechia::U\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nIceland::14\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17\r\nIreland::12PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13',12),(100,'1623205','Oz the Great and Powerful','Oz the Great and Powerful','Oz the Great and Powerful\r\nOz: El poderoso\r\nOz: Mágico e Poderoso\r\nОз: Великият и могъщият\r\nOz le magnifique\r\nOz, el poderoso\r\nCarstvo Velikog Oza\r\nMocný vládce Oz\r\nSuur ja kõikvõimas Oz\r\nMahtava Oz\r\nLe monde fantastique d\'Oz\r\nDie fantastische Welt von Oz\r\nOz: Megas kai pantodynamos\r\nΟζ: Μέγας και παντοδύναμος\r\nÓz, a hatalmas\r\nEretz Oz\r\nIl grande e potente Oz\r\nOzu Hajimari no Tatakai\r\nオズ　はじまりの戦い\r\nVarenais no Oza zemes\r\nOzas: didis ir galingas\r\nOz - Den store og mektige\r\nOz: Wielki i Potężny\r\nOz: O Grande e Poderoso\r\nGrozavul si puternicul Oz\r\nОз: Великий и Ужасный\r\nOz, veliki i moćni\r\nCesta do krajiny Oz\r\nMogocni Oz\r\nOz, un mundo de fantasía\r\nOz: Un mundo de fantasía\r\n奧茲大帝\r\nMuhteşem ve Kudretli Oz\r\nОз: Великий та Могутній\r\nBrick\r\nOz The Great and Powerful\r\nLạc Vào Xứ Oz Vĩ Đại Và Quyền Năng',2013,130,6.3,204898,'English','United States','Adventure\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy','Sam Raimi','Mitchell Kapner\r\nDavid Lindsay-Abaire\r\nMitchell Kapner\r\nL.

At first he thinks he\'s hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone\'s been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.\r\n-\r\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\r\n\r\nIn 1905, in Kansas, the small-time circus magician Oscar \"Oz\" Diggs is a weak, greedy, selfish and womanizer conman without character. He gives music boxes to the women that he seduces, and when a strong artist finds that his wife has a box in her belongings, he chases Oz through the circus. Oz flees in a balloon, but a tornado strikes his balloon and he lands on the Land of Oz. Oscar meets the gorgeous Theodora and she believes that he is the powerful magician from an ancient prophecy that will release her land from the Wicked Witch. Theodora tells that her sister and she are good witches, but the Wicked Witch had killed the king. Now the people are waiting for the magician to be their new king after defeating the witch. Theodora is seduced by Oz and brings him to the City of Emerald. When he sees the king\'s treasure, he decides to seek out the Wicked Witch and destroy her magic wand to get rid off her and become the king. Oz meets Glinda, who is supposed to be the Wicked witch, and soon he learns that Theodora\'s sister Evanora is the evil one indeed. Meanwhile Evanora lures he sister that is jealous and uses a spell to turn her into a wicked witch. Oscar learns that he is the only hope for the inhabitants of Oz that believe that he is a powerful magician and his only chance to defeat Evanora and Theodora is using illusion since he has no magic power.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nStranded with his hot air balloon during a wild tempest, Oscar \"Oz\" Diggs, an ambitious and smug magician of a travelling circus, he will eventually land in the mythical Land of Oz. In the streets of the Emerald city, he will encounter many strange creatures as well as the good people of Oz who will all see him as the wizard who was prophesied to save the peaceful land from the clutches of the Wicked Witch. Sooner or later, Oscar will have to use all of his tricks that hides in his sleeves, equal doses of imagination and sensory manipulation by means of theatrical illusion, all topped with a sprinkle of magic to prove without a doubt that he can be indeed the Great Wizard of Oz.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nShady illusionist Oscar Diggs (James Franco) enchants curious audiences at a Kansas circus. A self-professed con man, he\'s a fast-talking performer who aspires to follow in the footsteps of inventors like Thomas Edison. Oscar is being chased across the circus grounds by the rampaging Strongman when a tornado blows in and everyone runs for cover. Seeing a hot-air balloon as his only chance for escape, the illusionist jumps in and cuts himself free. Magically transported to the wondrous world of Oz, he soon encounters Theodora (Mila Kunis), a temperamental witch who surmises that he is the wizard named after their land (Oscar\'s nickname is Oz), foretold to fall from the sky, defeat a nasty witch, and ascend to the throne. Theodora takes Oscar to the Emerald City to meet her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), a powerful witch who reveals that he cannot become the rightful ruler of Oz until he\'s accomplished his mission. Later, as Oscar and his new flying-monkey companion Finley (voice of Zach Braff) prepare to face their fearsome enemy, they\'re joined by the fragile but fearless China Girl (voice of Joey King) and benevolent witch Glinda the Good (Michelle Williams), who help them prepare for the arduous battle ahead. Together with the brave people of Oz, Oscar draws up a plan to rid the land of evil once and for all, and become the great and powerful king who will rule from his throne in the Emerald City.k.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:52:23','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nTurkey::7A\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',12),(101,'0111161','The Shawshank Redemption','Shawshank Redemption','The Shawshank Redemption\r\nSueño de Libertad\r\nDie Verurteilten\r\nShoushenkden Qacish\r\nВыкупленьне з Шаўшэнку\r\nUm Sonho de Liberdade\r\nИзкуплението Шоушенк\r\nÀ l\'ombre de Shawshank\r\nSueños de fuga\r\nSueños de Libertad\r\n肖申克的救赎\r\nIskupljenje u Shawshanku\r\nVykoupení z věznice Shawshank\r\nEn verden udenfor\r\nShawshanki lunastus\r\nRita Hayworth - nyckel till flykten\r\nRita Hayworth - Avain pakoon\r\nAvain pakoon\r\nShawshank Redemption - Avain pakoon\r\nLes Évadés\r\nGaqceva shoushenkidan\r\nΤελευταία έξοδος: Ρίτα Χέιγουορθ\r\nTeleftaia exodos: \'Rita Hayworth\'\r\n月黑高飛\r\nA remény rabjai\r\nRastegari dar Shawshank\r\nHomot Shel Tikva\r\nLe ali della libertà\r\nShôshanku no sora ni\r\nショーシャンクの空に\r\nPabėgimas iš Šoušenko\r\nSueños de libertad\r\nSueño de fuga\r\nDe ontsnapping\r\nFrihetens regn\r\nThe Prisoner\r\nSkazani na Shawshank\r\nOs Condenados de Shawshank\r\nÎnchisoarea îngerilor\r\nПобег из Шоушенка\r\nБекство из Шошенка\r\nVykúpenie z väznice Shawshank\r\nKaznilnica odrešitve\r\nCadena perpetua\r\nCadena perpètua\r\nNyckeln till frihet\r\n刺激1995\r\nShawshank Mittraphap Khwamwang Khwamrunraeng\r\nEsaretin Bedeli\r\nВтеча з Шоушенка\r\nRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\r\nSueño de libertad\r\nShoushenkdan qochish\r\nNhà tù Shawshank',1994,142,9.3,2540301,'English','United States','Drama','Frank Darabont','Stephen King\r\nFrank Darabont','Liz Glotzer\r\nDavid V.

Over time Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can in a prison, leaving a message for all that while the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned.\r\n-\r\nDave Moody','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:53:44','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::18\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::RP16\r\nNigeria::12A\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C16',18),(102,'0099685','Goodfellas','Goodfellas','Goodfellas\r\nBuenos muchachos\r\nGoodFellas - Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia\r\nOs Bons Companheiros\r\nДобри момчета\r\nLes affranchis\r\n好家伙\r\nDobri momci\r\nMafiáni\r\nGangsteři\r\nOmad poisid\r\nMaffiabröder\r\nMafiaveljet\r\nMafiaVeljet\r\nTa kala paidia\r\nΤα καλά παιδιά\r\nNagymenők\r\nRofagha-ye khoub\r\nRofagha-ye khoob\r\nQuei bravi ragazzi\r\nGuddoferozu\r\nグッドフェローズ\r\nLabie puiši\r\nGeri vyrukai\r\nMafiabrør\r\nMafiabrødre\r\nChłopcy z ferajny\r\nTudo Bons Rapazes\r\nBăieți buni\r\nСлавные парни\r\nДобри момци\r\nDobri fantje\r\nUn dels nostres\r\nUno de los nuestros\r\n四海好傢伙\r\nSıkı Dostlar\r\nСлавні хлопці\r\nGood Fellas\r\nWiseguy\r\nGoodFellas',1990,146,8.7,1098067,'English\r\nItalian','United States','Biography\r\nCrime\r\nDrama','Martin Scorsese','Nicholas Pileggi\r\nNicholas Pileggi\r\nMartin Scorsese','Barbara De Fina\r\nBruce S.

His two partners could kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to think about climbing up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, might be badly affected by his partners\' success, but will he consider stooping low enough to bring about the downfall of Jimmy and Tommy?\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nThis film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960\'s and 70\'s New York. Henry Hill is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy DeVito is a purebred gangster, who turns out to be Henry\'s best friend. Jimmy Conway puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero, to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe story of Irish-Italian American, Henry Hill, and how he lives day-to-day life as a member of the Mafia. Based on a true story, the plot revolves around Henry and his two unstable friends Jimmy and Tommy as they gradually climb the ladder from petty crime to violent murders.\r\n-\r\nGraeme Roy\r\n\r\nThe lowly, blue-collar side of New York\'s Italian mafia is explored in this crime biopic of wiseguy Henry Hill. As he makes his way from strapping young petty criminal, to big-time thief, to middle-aged cocaine addict and dealer, the film explores in detail the rules and traditions of organized crime. Watching the rise and fall of Hill and his two counterparts, the slick jack-of-all-trades criminal Jimmy Conway and the brutish, intimidating Tommy DeVito, this true story realistically explores the core, blue-collar part of the mob.\r\n-\r\nDustin B.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-13 12:59:36','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::R18+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::18A\r\nChile::18\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::19\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C18',18),(103,'0120815','Saving Private Ryan','Saving Private Ryan','Saving Private Ryan\r\nRescatando al soldado Ryan\r\nDer Soldat James Ryan\r\nSpašavanje vojnika Ryana\r\nO Resgate do Soldado Ryan\r\nСпасяването на редник Райън\r\nIl faut sauver le soldat Ryan\r\n拯救大兵瑞恩\r\nZachraňte vojína Ryana\r\nReamees Ryani päästmine\r\nRädda soldat Ryan\r\nPelastakaa sotamies Ryan\r\npelastakaa sotamies ryan\r\nRigiti Raianis Gadasarchenad\r\nI diasosi tou stratioti Ryan\r\nΗ διάσωση του στρατιώτη Ράιαν\r\nRyan közlegény megmentése\r\nNejat-e sarbaz rayan\r\nSalvate il soldato Ryan\r\nPrivate Ryan\r\nPuraibeto Raian\r\nプライベート・ライアン\r\nGelbstint eilinį Rajeną\r\nRedd menig Ryan\r\nSzeregowiec Ryan\r\nSalvați soldatul Ryan\r\nСпасти рядового Райана\r\nСпасавање редова Рајана\r\nZachráňte vojaka Ryana\r\nReševanje vojaka Ryana\r\nSalvar al soldado Ryan\r\n搶救雷恩大兵\r\nFa Samoraphum Narok\r\nEr Ryan\'ı Kurtarmak\r\nВрятувати рядового Раяна\r\nOddiy askar Rayanni qutqarish\r\nGiải Cứu Binh Nhì Ryan',1998,169,8.6,1325302,'English\r\nFrench\r\nGerman\r\nCzech','United States','Drama\r\nWar','Steven Spielberg','Robert Rodat','Ian Bryce\r\nBonnie Curtis\r\nKevin de la Noy\r\nMark Gordon\r\nMark Huffam\r\nGary Levinsohn\r\nAllison Lyon Segan\r\nSteven Spielberg','John Williams','Tom Hanks\r\nTom Sizemore\r\nEdward Burns\r\nBarry Pepper\r\nAdam Goldberg\r\nVin Diesel\r\nGiovanni Ribisi\r\nJeremy Davies\r\nMatt Damon\r\nTed Danson\r\nPaul Giamatti\r\nDennis Farina\r\nJoerg Stadler\r\nMax Martini\r\nDylan Bruno\r\nDaniel Cerqueira\r\nDemetri Goritsas\r\nIan Porter\r\nGary Sefton\r\nJulian Spencer\r\nSteve Griffin\r\nWilliam Marsh\r\nMarc Cass\r\nMarkus Napier\r\nNeil Finnighan\r\nPeter Miles\r\nPaul Garcia\r\nSeamus McQuade\r\nRonald Longridge\r\nAdam Shaw\r\nRolf Saxon\r\nCorey Johnson\r\nLoclann Aiken\r\nJohn Barnett\r\nMaclean Burke\r\nVictor Burke\r\nAiden Condron\r\nPaschal Friel\r\nShane Hagan\r\nPaul Hickey\r\nShane Johnson\r\nLaird Macintosh\r\nBrian Maynard\r\nMartin McDougall\r\nMark Phillips\r\nLee Aaron Rosen\r\nAndrew Scott\r\nMatthew Sharp\r\nVincent Walsh\r\nGrahame Wood\r\nJohn Sharian\r\nGlenn Wrage\r\nCrofton Hardester\r\nMartin Hub\r\nRaffaello Degruttola\r\nNigel Whitmey\r\nSam Ellis\r\nErich Redman\r\nTilo Keiner\r\nStephan Grothgar\r\nStephane Cornicard\r\nMichelle Evans\r\nMartin Beaton\r\nAnna Maguire\r\nNathan Fillion\r\nLeland Orser\r\nMichael Mantas\r\nDavid Vegh\r\nRyan Hurst\r\nNick Brooks\r\nSam Scudder\r\nJohn Walters\r\nDorothy Grumbar\r\nJames Innes-Smith\r\nHarve Presnell\r\nDale Dye\r\nBryan Cranston\r\nDavid Wohl\r\nEric Loren\r\nValerie Colgan\r\nAmanda Boxer\r\nHarrison Young\r\nKathleen Byron\r\nRob Freeman\r\nThomas Gizbert\r\nSebastian J.

Desmond then saves the life of a worker, experiencing a wholesome satisfaction in the process. In the hospital, he is smitten by a nurse, who he then dates. After the United States enters the Second World War, both sons enlist, adding to the ire of the father who despises his sons joining the Army. The rigorous regimen of training in the Army requires Desmond to clear his firearms training, but after a huge tiff with his seniors, his father, an old corporal, intervenes to save Desmond from being court-martialed and serve with the Army as a medic.

As an army medic Doss single-handedly evacuated the wounded near enemy lines - braving enemy fire and putting his own life on the line. He was the first conscientious objector to ever earn the Congressional Medal of Honor.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nThe true story of Pfc. Desmond T.

Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw but left with no options he pushed forward. After 3 days of battle all the Greeks were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected, as a local shepherd, named Ephialtes, defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes that the separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks, was not as heavily guarded as they thought.\r\n-\r\ncyberian2005\r\n\r\n300 tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. Persians under the rule of King Xerxes have already taken over some of the Hellenic city-states, and now threaten Sparta and Athens. King Leonidas of Sparta is left with two options: he will either have to sacrifice himself for the well-being of Sparta or watch it burn to the ground. Choosing the former, Leonidas forms an army of 300 Spartan warriors to block the narrow passage of Thermopylae where Xerxes intends to reach Hellas. The 300 are accompanied by about 700 Thespians who protect the flanks of the passage, and combined, the forces manage to slay tens of thousands of Persians and prevent their entry into Hellas for several days. However, Ephialtes, a reject of the Spartan Army gets his revenge by showing Xerxes a secret goat passage up the flanks of the passage. The story depicts the epic last stand of the finest Spartan soldiers who are aware of their fate, but motivated by \"honor and glory\", see the battle as their duty to protect the rest of Greece for as long as possible.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nIn 480 BC, the Persian king Xerxes sends his massive army to conquer Greece. The Greek city of Sparta houses its finest warriors, and 300 of these soldiers are chosen to meet the Persians at Thermopylae, engaging the soldiers in a narrow canyon where they cannot take full advantage of their numbers. The battle is a suicide mission, meant to buy time for the rest of the Greek forces to prepare for the invasion. However, that doesn\'t stop the Spartans from throwing their hearts into the fray, determined to take as many Persians as possible with them.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner\r\n\r\nWhen the ambitious King Xerxes of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave King Leonidas brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas\'s army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 06:39:52','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIran::(Banned)\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R15\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(107,'0244244','Swordfish','Swordfish','Swordfish\r\nSwordfish, acceso autorizado\r\nPasswort: Swordfish\r\nA Senha: Swordfish\r\nПарола: Риба меч\r\nOpération Swordfish\r\nSwordfish: Acceso autorizado\r\nAcceso autorizado\r\nOperacija Swordfish\r\nSwordfish: Operace Hacker\r\nSwordfish - kodeord sværdfisk\r\nOperatsioon Mõõkkala\r\nSalasana: Swordfish\r\nOpération Espadon\r\nKodikos: Swordfish\r\nΚωδικός: Swordfish\r\nKardhal\r\nCodice: Swordfish\r\nSôdofisshu\r\nソードフィッシュ\r\nOperācija: Zobenzivs\r\nKardžuve\r\nPez Espada\r\nKod dostępu\r\nOperação Swordfish\r\nOperaţiunea Swordfish\r\nCod de acces: Swordfish\r\nПароль «Рыба-меч»\r\nШифра: Сабљарка\r\nSwordfish: Operácia Haker\r\nOperacija Mecarica\r\nOperación Swordfish\r\n劍魚\r\nKod adı kılıçbalığı\r\nПароль Риба-Меч\r\nSwordfish_\r\nMật Mã Cá Kiếm',2001,99,6.5,184116,'English\r\nGerman','United States','Action\r\nCrime\r\nThriller','Dominic Sena','Skip Woods','Bruce Berman\r\nDan Cracchiolo\r\nAnson Downes\r\nLinda Favila\r\nJonathan D.

New to the detail is Jack Silva, who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by Tyrone \"Rone\" Woods, commander of the GRS team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team and the CIA Chief of Station, who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-19','Mahesh','2020-04-14 06:45:03','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C18',18),(109,'0075314','Taxi Driver','Taxi Driver','Taxi Driver\r\nTaxi Driver: Motorista de Táxi\r\nШофьор на такси\r\nChauffeur de taxi\r\n出租车司机\r\nTaksist\r\nTaxikář\r\nTaxikár\r\nTaksojuht\r\nTaksikuski\r\nΟ ταξιτζής\r\n的士司機\r\nTaxisofőr\r\nRanandeh Taxi\r\nタクシードライバー\r\nTaksistas\r\nTaxisjåføren\r\nTaksówkarz\r\nȘoferul de taxi\r\nТаксист\r\nТаксиста\r\n計程車司機\r\nTaksi Şoförü\r\nKirakash\r\nTài Xế Taxi',1976,114,8.2,781873,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Crime\r\nDrama','Martin Scorsese','Paul Schrader','Phillip M.

As he suffers from insomnia, he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night, watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day, or thinking about how the world, New York in particular, has deteriorated into a cesspool. He\'s a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him, the one bright spot in New York humanity is Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. He becomes obsessed with her. After an incident with her, he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place in his opinion. One of his priorities is to be the savior for Iris, a twelve-year-old runaway and prostitute who he believes wants out of the profession and under the thumb of her pimp and lover Matthew.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nThe former marine Travis Bickle is insomniac and decides to work as taxi driver in the night shift. Travis is a lonely uneducated man that spends his leisure time watching porn films in the theaters. When Travis sees the gorgeous Betsy working as a volunteer in the campaign for president of Senator Charles Palantine, he has a crush on her. He invites Betsy to drink coffee with him and later he dates her. However he takes her to see a porn Swedish movie and she feels offended and leaves him. Travis unsuccessfully sends flowers for her but she rejects him. Travis meets the young prostitute Iris that is trying to flee from her pimp Sport in his taxi but Sport takes her from the car. Travis also buys several weapons from a dealer and practices shooting. When he meets Iris again, he is resolute to help her. Will Travis succeed in his intent?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nTravis Bickle is a lonely, impotent and insomniac ex-marine, who spends his nights driving his taxi throughout the shadowy streets of mid-70\'s New York City. Travis is fed up with the society he finds himself surrounded by, wishing that a \"real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets\". But Travis\'s personality sees him being unable to connect with virtually anyone, until he becomes infatuated with a blonde campaign worker named Betsy and then later meets an adolescent prostitute named Iris. As Travis grows increasingly more paranoid of his situations, he begins to sees these relationships he develops as \'missions\' of which he will need to be the saviour.\r\n-\r\nKyle Perez\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of bustling Big Apple, Travis Bickle--a depressed former U.S. Marine and a chronically insomniac lone wolf--prowls the night streets of the metropolis\' dark underbelly in his yellow cab. A nobody amid nobodies against the backdrop of an increasingly distorted perceived reality, Travis delves deeper and deeper into his world of obsession and vitriolic revulsion, as an endless string of bitter rejections from unobtainable objects of desire; condemned young souls, and even his colleagues, can only lead to a flaming manifesto of violence. Now, as Travis braces up to clean up this filthy city, his hungry and lethal weapons will become the grim messengers of truth. His truth.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nNew York City taxi driver Travis Bickle constantly, almost obsessively, reflects on the ugly corruption of life around him, and becomes increasingly disturbed over his own loneliness and alienation. In nearly every phase of his life, he remains a complete outsider, failing to make emotional contact with anyone. Unable to sleep night after night, he haunts the local pornography emporiums to find diversion, and begins desperately thinking about an escape from his depressing existence.\r\n-\r\nfilmfactsman','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 06:49:24','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::R\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::18A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::18\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::X\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nWest Germany::18',18),(111,'1014759','Alice in Wonderland','Alice in Wonderland','Alice in Wonderland\r\nAlicia en el país de las maravillas\r\nAlice im Wunderland\r\nAlice no País das Maravilhas\r\nАлиса в страната на чудесата\r\nAlice au pays des merveilles\r\nAlisa u zemlji čudesa\r\nAlenka v říši divů\r\nAlice i Eventyrland\r\nAlice imedemaal\r\nLiisa Ihmemaassa\r\nAlice i Underlandet\r\nAlisa saotsrebata kvekanashi\r\nI Aliki sti hora ton thavmaton\r\nΗ Αλίκη στη χώρα των θαυμάτων\r\nAlice Csodaországban\r\nAlice Csodaországban IMAX 3D\r\nAlice ar tir na n-iontas\r\nAliza Be Eretz Ha Pla\'ot\r\nアリス・イン・ワンダーランド\r\nAlise Brīnumzemē\r\nAlisa stebuklu salyje\r\nAlicja w Krainie Czarów\r\nAlice în Tara Minunilor\r\nАлиса в Стране чудес\r\nАлиса у земљи чуда\r\nAlica v krajine zázrakov\r\nAlica v cudezni dezeli\r\nAlicia en el País de las Maravillas\r\n魔境夢遊\r\nAlis Harikalar Diyarında\r\nAlice Harikalar Diyarında\r\nАліса в країні чудес\r\nAlice\r\nAlice in Wonderland: An IMAX 3D Experience\r\nAlice Ở Xứ Sở Thần Tiên',2010,108,6.4,402639,'English','United States','Adventure\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy\r\nMystery','Tim Burton','Linda Woolverton\r\nLewis Carroll','Katterli Frauenfelder\r\nDerek Frey\r\nChris Lebenzon\r\nTom C.

She is on a quest to go back in time and rescue the Mad Hatter\'s family, but in order to do so she needs the Chronosphere - a device that enables time travel which only the human manifestation of time itself, Time has. As she journeys through time in a thrilling and dangerous adventure she learns more about why the Red Queen and the White Queen don\'t get along, and the actual truth about the Mad Hatter\'s family, but little does Alice know that you shouldn\'t try to change the past, but rather learn from it.\r\n-\r\nkhalidaun\r\n\r\nAlice has just returned from an adventure in which she captained a ship to China and back.

To escape the situation with Hamish, Alice follows Absolem, a talking bug, through the mirror into another world, a world she is rather familiar with. There she finds old friends like the Mad Hatter, White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Cheshire Cat. The Mad Hatter is in a poor state, pining for his family who died several years ago. To correct this, Alice meets Time, and steals his most valuable possession. This brings her into contact, and conflict, yet again with the irascible, insane Red Queen.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nAlice Kingsleigh has spent the past three years following in her father\'s footsteps and sailing the high seas. Upon her return to London from China, she learns her ex-fiance, Hamish Ascot, has taken over his father\'s company and plans to have Alice sell him over her father\'s ship in exchange for her family home. Alice follows a butterfly she recognizes as Absolem and returns to Wonderland through a mirror. Alice is greeted by the White Queen, the White Rabbit, the Tweedles, the Dormouse, the March Hare, Bayard and the Cheshire Cat. They inform her that the Mad Hatter, Tarrant Hightopp, is acting madder than usual because his family is missing. Alice tries to console him, but the Mad Hatter remains sure of his family\'s survival of the Attack of the Jabberwocky day..\r\n\r\nAlmost robbed of everything, the intrepid captain, Alice Kingsleigh, finds herself before a pressing dilemma; however, much to her surprise, a mysterious blue trail and an enchanted looking glass will swiftly transport her back to the colourful realm of Underland. There, an ailing Hatter who longs for his long-gone family believes that they are still alive somewhere--and, to further complicate matters--his loyal companions are unable to help.

Found by the mysterious Dr. Ido while trolling for cyborg parts, Alita becomes a lethal, dangerous being. She cannot remember who she is, or where she came from. But to Dr. Ido, the truth is all too clear. She is the one being who can break the cycle of death and destruction left behind from Tiphares. But to accomplish her true purpose, she must fight and kill. And that is where Alita\'s true significance comes to bear. She is an angel from heaven. She is an angel of death.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Harmon\r\n\r\nIn 2563, three hundred years after the war \"The Fall\", the mysterious scientist Dr. Dyson Ido finds part of a female cyborg in a junkyard and brings to his laboratory. He finds that her human brain is amnetic but intact and gives the name of his deceased daughter Alita to the cyborg. Alita meets on the street Dr. Ido\'s ex-wife Chiren, who is also a scientist that works to the powerful Zapan, and befriends the young Hugo, who brings cyborg\'s parts to Dr. Ido, and learns that both dream on moving to the floating city of Zalem. Hugo teaches Alita how to play Motorball and she learns that the champion of the Motorball Tournament moves to Zalem. Soon Alita discovers that Dr. Ido is a hunter warrior and after finding her cyborg body in a crashed spaceship, she decides to become also a hunter warrior but Dr. Ido refuses to replace her body. Who was Alita and what is the secret of the cyborg body found by Alita?Let us see what happens.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet in the 26th century, the story takes place 300 years after a societal collapse caused by a major war. In that society, it\'s a technological dark age following a pinnacle of achievement far beyond where we are right now. Cyborg technology is a way of life. People are augmented a lot as workers, so being a cyborg is not unusual. The main character is a cyborg. She has an organic human brain, and she looks like she\'s about fourteen years old. She has a completely artificial body and she\'s lost her memory. She is found in a wreckage and reconstituted by a cyber-surgeon who becomes her surrogate father.\r\n-\r\nTermlnatriX\r\n\r\nWhen Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past - she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she\'s grown to love.\r\n-\r\nTwentieth Century Fox','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:19:26','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::14\r\nBulgaria::C\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nEcuador::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nPuerto Rico::PG-13\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSerbia::12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(114,'1631867','Edge of Tomorrow','Edge of Tomorrow','Edge of Tomorrow\r\nAl filo del mañana\r\nNo Limite do Amanhã\r\nНа ръба на утрешния ден\r\nUn jour sans lendemain\r\nNa rubu budućnosti\r\nNa hraně zítřka\r\nHomse piiril\r\nEdge of Tomorrow - Live.

Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt). And, as Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy!\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros. Pictures\r\n\r\nWhen an alien race called Mimics invades and destroys Europe, London is the last resistance in the Old Continent. General Brigham plans an attack to France expecting to defeat the Mimics and orders Major William Cage, who is an American public relation officer, to cover the invasion. However Cage does not accept the assignment and threatens General Brigham to expose the casualties. He is arrested, accused of desertion, demoted to private and assigned to fight in the invasion under the command of the tough Sergeant Farell in the Heathrow Base. Humans are slaughtered in the invasion and Cage kills a Mimic and is sprayed by his blood; in less than five minutes combat, Cage dies. Surprisingly he awakes in the Heathrow Base and relives the same day over and over after dieing. Each time, Cage tries to fix the deaths of his squad and he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski who asks him to find her when he awakes in the base. Rita brings Cage to meet Dr. Carter who explains to him that he killed an Alpha and his blood has given the ability to reset time. Further, the last hope of earth is the destruction of the Mimic leader, referred to as the Omega, who is hidden. Will Cage and Rita succeed in their solitary mission?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nBefore the numbing technological superiority of the omnipotent extraterrestrial menace known only as the \"Mimics\", mankind stands helpless, doomed to accept an ignoble fate. Having harnessed an unfathomable ability, the hordes of the ferocious alien race are practically invincible; unless we, humans, come up with an unexpected and drastic counter-attack. When the unseasoned officer, Major William Cage, learns firsthand the magnitude of the problem with his own life, he quickly realises that death is only the beginning--each blood-drenched battle with the formidable foes brings him back to square one, only with a dash of improvement in his fighting capacity. Perhaps now, Cage, his legendary brother-in-arms, Rita Vrataski, and the rest of the world have a fighting chance against the otherworldly opponent. Can we solve the enemy\'s enigma?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:20:15','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C13',12),(339,'1951264','The Hunger Games: Catching Fire','Hunger Games: Catching Fire','The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\r\nLos juegos del hambre: En llamas\r\nJogos Vorazes: Em Chamas\r\nИгрите на глада: Възпламеняване\r\nHunger Games: L\'embrasement\r\nEn llamas: Los juegos del hambre\r\nIgre gladi: Plamen\r\nHunger Games: Vražedná pomsta\r\nNäljamängud: Lahvatab leek\r\nNälkäpeli - vihan liekit\r\nHunger Games: L\'Embrasement\r\nShimshilis tamashebi 2\r\nDie Tribute von Panem - Catching Fire\r\nThe Hunger Games: Fotia\r\nThe Hunger Games: Φωτιά\r\nΑγώνες πείνας: Φωτιά\r\nAz éhezők viadala: Futótűz\r\nMis\'hakei ha\'ra\'av: hitlak\'hout\r\nHunger Games: La ragazza di fuoco\r\nHangâ Gêmu 2\r\nハンガー・ゲーム2\r\nBada spēles: Spēle ar uguni\r\nBado žaidynes.

He\'s an artful dodger, so Martine, a former model with a thing for him, brings him her scheme: a bank\'s alarm is off for a couple weeks, so let\'s tunnel into the vault. He assembles a team, not realizing her real goal is a safe-deposit box with compromising photos of a royal: she needs the photos to trade for avoiding a jail sentence - and MI-5, or is it MI-6, is pulling the strings two steps removed. A Trinidadian thug, a high-end bordello owner, and a pornographer also have things stored in the vault, so the break-in threatens many a powerful personage. Is there any way these amateurs can pull it off?\r\n-\r\n\r\nIn 1971, criminal Michael X blackmails the British government with compromising photos of members of parliament practicing kinky sex with prostitutes. He keeps the photos in a safe deposit box in the Lloyds Bank at Baker Street. The ambitious MI-5 Federal Agent Tim Everett plots a bold plan to retrieve the pictures in a heist of the bank. He arrests former model Martine Love in the airport trafficking drugs and offers security information to her to facilitate to rob of the bank. Martine goes to East London and meets her former lover, car dealer Terry Leather, who is married with two daughters but owes money to a dangerous loan shark, and tells him that the bank\'s alarm will be deactivated during a few days. Terry summons his friends and the team of amateurs succeeds in the heist. However, together with the money, the gang also steels the photos of Michael X; the book with the transactions with dirty cops of the Scotland Yard and the pornographer Lew Vogel; and photos of politicians in the Sonia Bern\'s brothel. Now different groups organize a manhunt to Terry and his friends with different objectives.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nTerry is a small-time car dealer trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Martine is a beautiful model from Terry\'s old neighbourhood who knows that Terry is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a bank, Terry recognises the danger but realises this may be the opportunity of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn September 1971, thieves tunneled into the vault of a bank in London\'s Baker Street and looted safe deposit boxes of cash and jewelry worth over three million pounds. None of it was recovered. Nobody was ever arrested. The robbery made headlines for a few days and then disappeared - the result of a \'D\' Notice, gagging the press. This film reveals what was hidden for the first time.

Over time, Belle sees beyond the furry coat and she befriends him. The two spend long days together in the snow and the sun and gradually they fall in love.

But, as the years pass by in the desolate palace, an inadvertent mistake will condemn the kind and rebellious book-lover, Belle, to imprisonment within the thick-walled fortress, as the enchanted mansion\'s lord desperately seeks love\'s warm embrace. The Beast, trembles with fear knowing that his time is short, yet hope still lies in a frail rose\'s last petal.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It\'s now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon\'s trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell\'s fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell\'s assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael\'s assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn a dystopian 2019 Los Angeles of towering skyscrapers, the grizzled former Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, is called out of retirement when four rogue Nexus-6 replicants steal a spaceship and illegally enter Earth to find their creator, Dr Eldon Tyrell. As the synthetic humanoids become increasingly desperate to locate him, the officious bounty hunter, Deckard, leaves no stone unturned in the futuristic, neon-lit metropolis, trying to track down and \"retire\" the dangerous androids. However, more and more, Rick finds himself grappling with conflicting emotions. Will he let uncertainty, and even empathy, get in the way of duty?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants - humanoid androids with short, fixed lifespans - which are illegal on Earth, but are used in the off-world colonies.

Officer \"K\" (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what\'s left of society into chaos.

Pictures\r\n\r\nIn 2049, with the powerful Tyrell Corporation under the control of the idealistic scientist, Niander Wallace, the bio-engineered replicants, Nexus-9, seem to have integrated seamlessly into society. Purposed to eradicate the outdated rebellious Nexus models, LAPD\'s officer \"K\", a new generation of Blade Runners, stumbles upon a dangerous and well-hidden secret that could easily undermine the already fragile stability in the world. Little by little, as \"K\" tries to piece the evidence together, he comes to realise that one man is the key element in this mystery: the retired Blade Runner (1982), Rick Deckard, who has either disappeared or gone underground. But, is \"K\" allowed to unearth the truth?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nRick Deckard has vanished. The notorious Blade Runner has been missing since 2019 when he and Rachael escaped from the authorities, and in the process, also avoided the economic and social downfalls of the early 2020s. It\'s now 2049. Replicants are now closer to humans than ever before, and Blade Runners are still used to \"retire\" the older models that went into hiding from the notorious \"Blackout\" of 2022. In Deckard\'s place, \"K\" has taken the mantle of Los Angeles\' top Blade Runner. However, his world turns upside down when he discovers a box.\r\n-\r\nJohnny\r\n\r\n2049. It\'s been approximately two decades since the Tyrell Corporation, the creators and original manufacturers of replicants (bioengineered superhumans), went bankrupt, a new generation of replicants manufactured by industrialist Niander Wallace who saved the world with his replicants in establishing synthetic farming in light of collapsing natural ecosystems. While the replicants of the Tyrell era are now outlawed in they having violently rebelled, they \"retired\" (aka destroyed) by blade runners, the Wallace era replicants, which have been programmed to obey, are seen as necessary to society. Many current day blade runners are Wallace era replicants. K, short for his serial number KD6-3.7, is one such blade runner working for the LAPD under Lieutenant Joshi. On one of his assignments, K discovers what he believes are human remains, but on forensic examination are actually the remains of a female replicant who has signs of having given birth during her life, presumably to a human baby.

With a strong survival instinct, he has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Political unrest is rampant in Sierra Leone as people fight tooth for tooth. Upon meeting Solomon, and the beautiful Maddy, Archer\'s life changes forever as he is given a chance to make peace with the war around him.\r\n-\r\nMiist\r\n\r\nIn 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen, Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990\'s Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond is the story of Danny Archer - an ex mercenary from Zimbabwe - and Solomon Vandy - a Mende fisherman. Both men are African, but their histories as different as any can be, until their fates become joined in a common quest to recover a rare pink diamond that can transform their lives. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon - who was taken from his family and forced to work in the diamond fields - has found and hidden the extraordinary rough stone. With the help of Maddy Bowen, an American journalist whose idealism is tempered by a deepening connection with Archer, the two men embark on a trek through rebel territory, a journey that could save Solomon\'s family and give Archer the second chance he thought he would never have.\r\n-\r\nProduction','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:32:47','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::18\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',18),(127,'1037705','The Book of Eli','Book of Eli','The Book of Eli\r\nEl libro de los secretos\r\nO Livro de Eli\r\nКнигата на Илай\r\nLe livre d\'Élie\r\nKnjiga iskupljenja\r\nKniha přežití\r\nBook of Eli\r\nEli raamat\r\nLe Livre d\'Eli\r\nO eklektos\r\nΟ εκλεκτός\r\nÉli könyve\r\nद बुक ऑफ़ एली\r\nKetab e Eli\r\nCodice Genesi\r\nThe Walker\r\nザ・ウォーカー\r\nĪlaijas grāmata\r\nElijaus knyga\r\nKsięga ocalenia\r\nCartea lui Eli\r\nКнига Илая\r\nКњига спаса\r\nKniha prežitia\r\nKnjiga odresitve\r\nEl libro de Eli\r\n奪天書\r\nTanrının kitabı\r\nКнига Ілая\r\nCuốn Sách Của Eli',2010,118,6.9,309049,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Albert Hughes\r\nAllen Hughes','Gary Whitta','Brad Arensman\r\nYolanda T.

He finds solace in a unique book which he carries on his person and guards closely, while surviving by hunting small animals and seeking goods in destroyed houses and vehicles to trade in villages for water and supplies. When he reaches a village ruled by the powerful mobster, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the man views Eli\'s impressive fighting skills and offers Eli a place within his gang. Carnegie presses his blind lover Claudia (Jennifer Beals) to send her daughter, Solara (Mila Kunis), to at least convince Eli to spend the night by sleeping with him. However, Eli proves to be the better man when he gently declines her advances. The girl sees Eli\'s book, and when Carnegie finds out he beats her mother until she reveals what she saw.

Wallace creates a legend of himself, with his courageous defense of his people and attacks on the English.\r\n-\r\nRob Hartill','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:35:05','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R15\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(130,'1823672','Chappie','Chappie','Chappie\r\nЧaпи\r\nHumandroid\r\nチャッピー\r\nRobots vārdā Čapijs\r\nČapis\r\nРобот по имени Чаппи\r\nЧапи: Робот који је променио свет\r\n成人世界\r\nРобот Чаппі\r\nChappi laqabli robot\r\nChappie: Cảnh Sát Người Máy',2015,120,6.8,244180,'English','United States','Action\r\nCrime\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Neill Blomkamp','Neill Blomkamp\r\nTerri Tatchell','James Bitonti\r\nNeill Blomkamp\r\nVictoria Burkhart\r\nTrishia Downie\r\nSimon Kinberg\r\nBen Waisbren','Hans Zimmer','Sharlto Copley\r\nDev Patel\r\nNinja\r\nYo-Landi Visser\r\nJose Pablo Cantillo\r\nHugh Jackman\r\nSigourney Weaver\r\nBrandon Auret\r\nJohnny Selema\r\nAnderson Cooper\r\nMaurice Carpede\r\nJason Cope\r\nKevin Otto\r\nChris Shields\r\nBill Marchant\r\nRobert Hobbs\r\nMark K.

When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself.\r\n\r\nIn Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson. The former military Vincent Moore is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal\'s CEO Michelle Bradley asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa. In order to curb the high crime rate the police use robots to fight crime. This is an immediate success and the police order several more robots from the developer, Tetravaal. After falling foul of these robots, two criminals, Ninja and Yolandi, kidnap Tetravaal\'s chief engineer, and genius behind the robots, Deon Wilson, with the aim of getting him to deactivate them. To their surprise he is transporting one of the robots, Scout 22, as he is working on a personal project to give robots consciousness. Ninja and Yolandi see the opportunity to have a robot on their side and immediately set about attempting to train the robot to help them in their criminal activities. They also give him a name - Chappie.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nA law enforcing robot (agent 22) is severely damaged during an encounter between two rival criminal gangs.

Now possessing emotions, a name and the ability to choose between right & wrong what path will Chappie choose to tread on?\r\n-\r\nAshvin Moorooteea\r\n\r\nIn a crime-ridden near-future Johannesburg, the robotic squad of mechanised law enforcers known as the Scouts--state-of-the-art creations of the benign engineer, Deon Wilson--have managed to clean up the streets, minimising police officer casualties. However, when the criminal trio, Yo-Landi, Amerika, and Ninja, abduct Deon in high hopes of turning the powerful droids off, they end up with Scout #22: a mangled robot marked for destruction. Now, after a few repairs and a new AI software, a metal killer with the mind of an infant is theirs to do their bidding, provided mama Yo-Landi and papa Ninja show Chappie the ropes, and teach him a thing or two about the gangsta etiquette. Is Chappie capable of choosing his future?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn the near future, crime is patrolled by an oppressive mechanized police force. But now, the people are fighting back. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself.

Before long, a worldwide contest organised by Willy himself will set the stage for the adventure of a lifetime, as the world\'s greatest chocolate-maker announces that the fortunate boy or girl who comes up with one of out of five rare golden passes hidden in his famous and scrumptious Wonka Bars, will win a free tour of the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. By some miracle, Charlie, who only has enough money to buy one chocolate bar a year, finds the last fifth ticket, and, alongside with his beloved Grandpa Joe, and four other equally lucky children and their chaperones, set foot in cryptic Willy Wonka\'s remarkable world of chocolate. Of course, only one kid gets to win the grand prize.

Things change when Willy Wonka, head of the very popular Wonka Chocolate empire, announces a contest in which five gold tickets have been hidden in chocolate bars and sent throughout the country. The kids who find the tickets will be taken on a tour of Wonka\'s chocolate factory and get a special glimpse of the wonders within. Charlie miraculously finds a ticket, along with four other children much naughtier than him. The tour of the factory will hold more than a few surprises for this bunch.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner\r\n\r\nCharlie Bucket is a young boy who comes from a poor but loving family and would love nothing more than to find a golden ticket to enter the amazing chocolate factory run by inventor and owner Willy Wonka. As luck would have it, Charlie finds the last golden ticket and goes on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure with his grandpa Joe. Among the other four winners are Veruca Salt, a spoiled rich girl; Augustus Gloop, a gluttonous kid who stuffs his face with sweets; Violet Beuragarde, a champion trophy gum chewer; and Mike Teavee, a kid who spends more time watching TV and playing video games than anything else. Most fascinating is the mysterious Willy Wonka who in turn had a troubled childhood and has a special grand prize at the end for one of the kids.

He\'s in an unknown location, sedated, while various Chinese are harvesting his organs. His heart is gone, in an ice chest; a temporary in its place. Chev escapes, knowing only the name of the guy with the ice chest. He calls Doc Miles, an unlicensed cardiologist, who tells him there\'s only an hour\'s life in the artificial heart: keep it charged. Chev needs to find his own heart and get to Doc for a transplant. He starts his time-limited pursuit of shadowy figures, the ice chest, and his heart aided by Eve, Rei, and Venus - a stripper, a prostitute, and a pal with Tourette\'s - constantly needing an electric charge to keep going.\r\n-\r\n\r\nSome believe that, when you\'ve stared death in the face, everything after that is easy. However, after his high-octane experience in Crank (2006), the indestructible British assassin, Chev Chelios, finds himself neck-deep in trouble, and one heart short. This time, with his ticker removed and replaced with a temporary, battery-powered artificial heart, once again, Chev embarks on a frenzied quest to stay alive, on the hunt for his missing organ and Johnny Vang, a ruthless member of the Chinese Triad in Los Angeles. But, this is a race against time, and as Chelios leaves no stone unturned to find his stolen heart, he must never forget to recharge the device in his chest every so often, to keep himself going. The clock is ticking. Will Chev ever get his heart back?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:39:19','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::R18+\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::16+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::18\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nRomania::I.M.-18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::18\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::18',16),(134,'0338526','Van Helsing','Van Helsing','Van Helsing\r\nVan Helsing: El cazador de monstruos\r\nVan Helsing - O Caçador de Monstros\r\nВан Хелсинг\r\nΒαν Χέλσινγκ\r\nKallarai Manithan\r\nवैन हेल्सिंग\r\nヴァン・ヘルシング\r\nVan Helsingas\r\nVan Helsing: Cazador de monstruos\r\nВан Хельсинг\r\n凡赫辛\r\nВан Хелсінг\r\nВан Хельсінг\r\nВан Гельсінг',2004,131,6.1,258632,'English\r\nLatin','United States\r\nCzech Republic','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFantasy\r\nThriller','Stephen Sommers','Stephen Sommers','Bob Ducsay\r\nSam Mercer\r\nDavid Minkowski\r\nArtist W.

Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this house is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru (Steve Carell), planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad.

That is, if she can figure out who her killer is. She must relive that day, over and over again, dying in a different way each time. Can she solve her own murder?\r\n\r\nAfter a night of hard-partying and heavy-drinking, the self-centered college student and sorority sister, Tree Gelbman, wakes up on the morning of her birthday with a serious hangover, in the dorm of a guy whose name she can\'t recall. As Tree goes about her day, little does she know that everything that happens now or will occur during the course of the day, is a twisted déjà vu of a reality that repeats itself again and again, until her brutal murder at night by a masked madman. With every repetition--or better yet resurrection--Tree gets a little bit closer to the identity of her unknown killer; however, figuring out who he or she may be, always ends up with Tree\'s death. Wake up; figure out the killer; die; repeat. After all, practice makes perfect.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nAfter drunken partying the previous evening, university student Theresa \"Tree\" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of her classmate Carter Davis. She ignores a phone call from her father David and dismisses Carter while leaving his room and throws away a birthday cupcake given to her by her sorority housemate Lori Spengler. Tree also meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot - a baby. Tree immediately wakes up in the same way she had previously - in Carter\'s bed - and is unnerved to find the previous day\'s events repeating themselves. Baffled, she nonetheless relives the day and uses this second chance to avoid the tunnel and reach the party. However, the masked killer follows her to the party and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter\'s bed, realizes that she is in a time loop and barricades herself in her sorority house room to avoid death.

Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty-hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi.

In the midst of his search, Dr. Schultz crosses paths with Django (Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx), a freed slave and skilled tracker who seeks to rescue his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from ruthless plantation-owner Calvin Candie (Academy Award-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio). Once Django has aided Dr. Schultz in coral ling the Brittle brothers, the two team up to capture some of the most wanted men in the South. Meanwhile, Django never loses sight of his mission to free Broomhilda from the treacherous slave-trade before it is too late. Upon arriving at Candie\'s nefarious plantation, dubbed Candyland, Django and Dr. Schultz discover that slaves are being groomed for gladiator-like competitions by Candie\'s malevolent right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), and together they skillfully work their way onto the compound for a closer look. But just as Django and his partner locate Broomhilda and plot a daring escape, Candie\'s house-slave Stephen (Academy Award-nominee Samuel L. Jackson) catches wind of their plan, and informs his master of the betrayal. Now, as a clandestine organization attempts to back them into a corner, Django and Dr. Schultz will have to come out with pistols blazing if they ever hope to free Broomhilda from Candyland and the clutches of its vile proprietor.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:43:46','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14+\r\nChile::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::21+\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRomania::I.M.-18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',12),(138,'6857112','Us','Us','Us\r\nNosotros\r\nWir\r\nNós\r\nНас\r\nNous\r\nMi\r\nMy\r\nΕμείς\r\n我們．異\r\nअस\r\nAnakhnou\r\nNoi\r\nアス\r\nアス (映画)\r\nMēs\r\nTo my\r\nМы\r\nМи\r\n我們\r\nLon Luang Rao\r\nBiz\r\nChúng Ta',2019,116,6.8,267951,'English','United States\r\nChina\r\nJapan','Horror\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Jordan Peele','Jordan Peele','Jason Blum\r\nIan Cooper\r\nDaniel Lupi\r\nSean McKittrick\r\nJordan Peele\r\nBeatriz Sequeira\r\nDavid Torres','Michael Abels','Lupita Nyong\'o\r\nWinston Duke\r\nElisabeth Moss\r\nTim Heidecker\r\nShahadi Wright Joseph\r\nEvan Alex\r\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II\r\nAnna Diop\r\nCali Sheldon\r\nNoelle Sheldon\r\nMadison Curry\r\nAshley McKoy\r\nNapiera Groves\r\nLon Gowan\r\nAlan Frazier\r\nDuke Nicholson\r\nDustin Ybarra\r\nNathan Harrington\r\nKara Hayward\r\nDarrel Cherney\r\nJames Cobb\r\nAndrew Constantini\r\nCha-tah Ellem\r\nAlessandro Garcia\r\nLinda Joy Henry\r\nNicole Huynh\r\nSamantha Kelly\r\nJo King\r\nAndrew Koponen\r\nBrian Korsmeier\r\nAdam Mendez Jr.\r\nChristian Harris Neeman\r\nDebra Norton-Miller\r\nAnne-Marie Olsen\r\nDavid M Sandoval Jr.\r\nEvan Shwartz\r\nRay Walker\r\nJustin Williams','We Are Our Own Worst Enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom Jordan Peele, writer/director of \'Get Out,\' comes a New Nightmare\r\n\r\nWatch Yourself.\r\n\r\nTwo Years Ago, Jordan Peele Redefined the Genre with \"Get Out.\" On March 22, Discover His New Nightmare.','A family\'s serene beach vacation turns to chaos when their doppelgängers appear and begin to terrorize them.','A family\'s serene beach vacation turns to chaos when their doppelgängers appear and begin to terrorize them.\r\n\r\nIn order to get away from their busy lives, the Wilson family takes a vacation to Santa Cruz, California with the plan of spending time with their friends, the Tyler family.

Four hundred thousand British and French soldiers are hole up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats in addition to its hard-pressed Navy to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nWorld War II. The enemy forces have cornered four hundred thousand British and French soldiers on the French coast at Dunkirk. A small number of primarily-French soldiers are guarding the perimeter, where the British and French soldiers are amassed, which is getting increasingly smaller as enemy forces advance. Most of those British and French soldiers are now on the beach waiting for destroyers to come and take them back to Britain. Each of the countries are taking care of their own. The British are leaving first and among those the wounded get first priority despite their taking up seven times the space of the able-bodied soldiers. An issue with Dunkirk is that there is only one dock the destroyers can access, which needs to be protected from the enemy bombs. As such, Churchill, newly elected, has put out a call for civilian watercraft to head to Dunkirk both to transport supplies and to transport soldiers from the beach to the destroyers or back to Britain if at all possible. Within this situation, four general stories are told. In one, Commander Bolton, the top British Naval officer on the ground, knows deep in his heart that the soldiers are largely sitting ducks on the beach as the enemy planes fly over. He knows that the situation is a catch-22 for the British in that they need to bring as many soldiers safely home as possible at the depletion of their military resources, which in turn they need to preserve for the day if, but more likely when, the enemies make their way onto British soil. In the second story, a squadron of three Royal Air Force Spitfires are amongst those limited air resources that are embarking in dog fights with enemy planes, while protecting the soldiers on the ground. In the process, they have to ensure their own safety in order to provide what is needed for the ground soldiers, which includes knowing about things like fuel levels and having enough to make their way back to home base whenever required. In the third story, two soldiers meet on the beach, the two of them knowing that the longer they remain on the beach, the likelier they are not to survive this skirmish. As such, they try to do whatever they need to to make it onto one of those destroyers or any other watercraft making its way back to Britain. However, making it aboard a ship does not necessarily ensure their survival, and in the final story, Mr. Dawson, his young-adult son Peter, and their seventeen-year-old friend George are on Dawson\'s pleasure craft making its way to Dunkirk to do their part in the war effort, all realizing the dangers involved. They have to decide at each step along the way if they will focus on personal problems or if they will continue on to assist in the war, as was their first priority when they left Britain.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable Naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, three hundred thirty thousand French, British, Belgian, and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nLate May 1940. Already eight months into World War II, Adolf Hitler\'s formidable army sweeps into Belgium, and then, France is next. As a result, the outnumbered Allied Forces collapse under the sheer volume of the invader, and 400,000 troops find themselves with their backs to the cold North Sea, stranded on the sandy shores of the French coastal town of Dunkirk. Now, with the relentless German Luftwaffe hammering the beach, and with the distance between England and continental Europe just 33.3 kilometres across the Strait of Dover, the massive evacuation operation code-named Operation Dynamo commences, involving hundreds of naval and civilian vessels. As three Royal Air Force Spitfires try to fend off the Nazi attacks and buy some time, the grizzled civilian captain, Mr Dawson, his son, Peter, and his friend, George, struggle to rescue as many soldiers as they can, in a desperate operation that will serve as a pivotal point for the war effort, and become known as the \"Miracle of Dunkirk\".\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:44:54','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nColombia::7\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(140,'1320253','The Expendables','Expendables','The Expendables\r\nLos indestructibles\r\nOs Mercenários\r\nНепобедимите\r\nLes sacrifiés\r\nPlaćenici\r\nExpendables: Postradatelní\r\nPalgasõdurid\r\nExpendables: Unité spéciale\r\nGasaghebulebi\r\nThe Expendables - Stahlharte Söldner\r\nOi analosimoi\r\nΟι αναλώσιμοι\r\nThe Expendables - A feláldozhatók\r\nHa\'bilti nishkahim\r\nI mercenari - The Expendables\r\nExpendables\r\nエクスペンダブルズ\r\nNeiznīcināmie\r\nNesunaikinami\r\nNiezniszczalni\r\nEroi de sacrificiu\r\nНеудержимые\r\nПлаћеници\r\nPlačanci\r\nLos mercenarios\r\n浴血任務\r\nCehennem Melekleri\r\nНестримні\r\nLos Indestructibles\r\nChegarasiz\r\nBiệt Đội Đánh Thuê\r\nLinh Danh Thue',2010,103,6.5,338703,'English\r\nSpanish','United States\r\nBulgaria\r\nSpain\r\nGermany','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nThriller','Sylvester Stallone','Dave Callaham\r\nSylvester Stallone\r\nDave Callaham','Guymon Casady\r\nJason Constantine\r\nBoaz Davidson\r\nDanny Dimbort\r\nRobert Earl\r\nJon Feltheimer\r\nBasil Iwanyk\r\nEda Kowan\r\nAvi Lerner\r\nMatthew O\'Toole\r\nEdu Sallouti\r\nJ.

During the interview, Christian Grey takes an interest in Anastasia. Soon after it, he visits the hardware store where Anastasia works and offers her to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Anastasia had interviewed him. Later, Grey invites her to a cafe and also sends her first edition copies of two Thomas Hardy novels, including Tess of the d\'Urbervilles, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card.

Christian dates Ana and offers a non-disclosure agreement to her to keep in secret their relationship.

However, Grey\'s unexpected offer leads to an unusual agreement, one that will lure the incurably romantic woman into his well-hidden world. Now, little by little, Christian entices Anastasia into a sensual reality, seducing her to explore her limits in an unrestrained passion, and tempting her to embrace the cathartic feeling of being different. Above all, Anastasia wants to mend Christian\'s broken heart; nevertheless, for love\'s salted wounds, there are no safe words.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:47:50','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::16+\r\nChile::18\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nColombia::18\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::(Banned)\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nLithuania::N-18\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+R\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::Unrated\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C18',16),(142,'1907668','Flight','Flight','Flight\r\nEl vuelo\r\nO Voo\r\nПолет\r\nVol\r\nLet\r\nLend\r\nLento\r\nKényszerleszállás\r\nHa\'tisa\r\nFuraito\r\nフライト\r\nLidojums\r\nSkrydis\r\nLot\r\nDecisão de Risco\r\nZborul\r\nЭкипаж\r\nЛет\r\nEl vuelo (Flight)\r\n機密真相\r\nUçuş\r\nРейс\r\nEl Vuelo\r\nChuyến Bay',2012,138,7.3,343874,'English','United States\r\nUnited Arab Emirates','Drama\r\nThriller','Robert Zemeckis','John Gatins','Heather Kelton\r\nLaurie MacDonald\r\nCherylanne Martin\r\nWalter F.

While on a flight from Orlando to Atlanta something goes wrong and the plane starts to fly erratically. With little choice Whip crashes the plane and saves almost all on board. When he wakes up in the hospital, his friend from the airline union introduces him to a lawyer who tells him there\'s a chance he could face criminal charges because his blood test reveals that he was intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine. He denies being impaired, so while an investigation is underway, he is told to keep his act together.

Whip spends the night in Orlando with Trina drinking and using cocaine. On the next morning, he assumes the Flight 227 to Atlanta and he faces turbulence at the take-off. Out of the blue, the plane has a mechanical problem and the skilled Whip crashes the plane in an empty field and saves the lives of ninety-six persons on board; however, four passengers and two crew members are killed. Whip learns that there will be an investigation by his friend Charlie Anderson from the union and the defense lawyer Hugh Lang tells him that he may have a life sentence since his blood test indicates that he was intoxicated with alcohol and drugs. Charlie and Hugh also advise him to keep sober over the next few days. But Whip is an alcoholic and struggles to control his addiction.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAlcoholic pilot Whip Whittaker (Denzel Washington) does a miraculous job crash-landing a plane that has suffered a severe mechanical breakdown in midair, however the mandated investigation into the incident will inevitably lead to the discovery that he was flying the plane while drunk and on cocaine. As he attempts to sober up, Whip befriends a fellow addict he meets during his post-accident stay in the hospital. Soon he fails in his attempts to white-knuckle himself to sobriety, and with the help of his favorite drug-dealer (John Goodman) and his lawyer (Don Cheadle), Whip must prepare to testify about what happened on that fateful flight.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:49:10','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::18A\r\nColombia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nThailand::20\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',12),(143,'0480249','I Am Legend','I Am Legend','I Am Legend\r\nSoy leyenda\r\nMen Efsaneyem\r\nJe suis une légende\r\nEu Sou a Lenda\r\nАз съм легенда\r\nJa sam legenda\r\nJá, legenda\r\nMa olen legend\r\nZontanos thrylos\r\nΖωντανός θρύλος\r\nLegenda vagyok\r\nMan Afsane-am\r\nIo sono leggenda\r\nアイ・アム・レジェンド\r\nEs esmu leģenda\r\nAs esu legenda\r\nJestem legendą\r\nLegenda vie\r\nЯ легенда\r\nЈа сам легенда\r\nJa, legenda\r\nSom legenda\r\nJaz, legenda\r\n我是傳奇\r\nBen Efsaneyim\r\nЯ - легенда\r\nI Am Legend: The IMAX Experience\r\nMen afsonaman\r\nTôi Là Huyền Thoại',2007,101,7.2,728191,'English','United States','Action\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Francis Lawrence','Mark Protosevich\r\nAkiva Goldsman\r\nRichard Matheson\r\nJohn William Corrington\r\nJoyce Hooper Corrington','Bruce Berman\r\nDana Goldberg\r\nAkiva Goldsman\r\nDavid Heyman\r\nJames Lassiter\r\nNeal H.

Immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague - the Infected - lurk in the shadows - watching Neville\'s every move - waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind\'s last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood.

But a few years later, it mutated into plague that kills most of the people on Earth or turns them into creatures, There are a few who are immune.

But he is losing hope until two others who are also immune show up.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nAdapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson\'s influential novelette of the same name, this movie follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampire plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious super-bug. Now the entire population of New York City - and perhaps the world - has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It\'s been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day, he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night, he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville\'s blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nMeandering through a barren and ravaged post-apocalyptic Manhattan rendered uninhabitable by a virulent genetically mutated plague, the brilliant virologist and sole survivor, Robert Neville, still hopes to find signs of life, three long years after the devastating outbreak.

However--vastly outnumbered, scared to death, yet determined to prevail--Robert knows that, sooner or later, there will be no place to hide; then, the only living man in New York will have to make his tragic and heroic last stand against the dangerously resourceful adversary.

After successfully protecting the planet for three years, something is starting to go wrong. Two estranged brothers are tasked with solving the program\'s malfunction before a world wide Geostorm can engulf the planet.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to save the planet from the devastating effects of the extreme climate change, an eminent team of scientists led by Jake Lawson, manage to build a powerful and elaborate network of satellites known as the \"Dutch Boy\", to practically control the weather. However, when unexplained accidents and catastrophic weather malfunctions start to occur, it will be evident that what was invented to protect the Earth, has now become its nemesis, wreaking havoc with random attacks. Can Jake and his estranged brother, Max, stop the string of dysfunctions before a Geostorm--an annihilating worldwide meteorological phenomenon--obliterates mankind?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn 2019, following many catastrophic natural disasters, an international coalition commissions a system of climate-controlling satellites called \"Dutch Boy\". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a typhoon in Shanghai, a Senate sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson for acting without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom. Three years later, a UN team stationed in the Registan Desert comes across a frozen village. As suspicions rise about the event being caused by a malfunction of Dutch Boy, the US government decides to send one person to find and fix the system. Later, Makmoud Habib, an Indian engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS), is shown copying data from the Afghanistan satellite onto an external storage device. Habib stores it in his station locker, but he is unexpectedly ejected into space and killed. After convincing President Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. Another satellite increases temperatures in Hong Kong, causing gas main explosions that nearly kill Max\'s college friend Cheng Long, the head of Dutch Boy\'s Hong Kong department..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:52:17','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C13',12),(146,'1133985','Green Lantern','Green Lantern','Green Lantern\r\nLinterna Verde\r\nLanterna Verde\r\nЗеленият фенер\r\nLinterna verde\r\nΠράσινος Φανός\r\n綠燈俠\r\nZöld Lámpás\r\nAvatar 2011\r\nグリーン・ランタン\r\nZaļais lukturis\r\nŽaliasis žibintas\r\nZielona Latarnia\r\nGreen Lantern - Lanterna Verde\r\nGreen Lantern 3D: Protectorul Universului\r\nЗеленый Фонарь\r\nЗелени Фењер\r\nZelena svetilka\r\nGeurillaenteon: Banjiui Seontaek\r\nGreen Lantern (Linterna Verde)\r\n綠光戰警\r\nYeşil Fener\r\nЗелений Ліхтар\r\nEmerald Dawn\r\nYashil Fonus\r\nChiến Binh Đèn Lồng Xanh',2011,114,5.5,279188,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','Martin Campbell','Greg Berlanti\r\nMichael Green\r\nMarc Guggenheim\r\nMichael Goldenberg\r\nGreg Berlanti\r\nMichael Green\r\nMarc Guggenheim','Greg Berlanti\r\nDonald De Line\r\nHerbert W.

Reckless test pilot Hal Jordan acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by the Ring, the willpower-fed source of power. Reluctantly at first, he takes on the challenge after the death of Abin Sur, the finest Green Lantern. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal, colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax, a powerful, evil being who feeds on fear. Hal Jordan is the universe\'s last chance, as many Green Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened, and he might just be the right Green Lantern for the duty of keeping the world safe from harm.\r\n-\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nThe Guardians of the Universe have divided the universe into 3,600 space sectors, each one protected by one powerful Green Lantern, selected among fearless beings and supplied by a ring fed by the willpower from the planet Oa. When the evil force Parallax that is fed by fear destroys several Green Lanterns, Abin Sur flees in his spacecraft but crashes on Earth. Mortally wounded, his green ring seeks out a successor for him and finds the reckless but efficient test pilot Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan learns about the Green Lanterns and is bestowed with the powers of the ring. Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond is summoned to conduct an autopsy of Abin Sur and is possessed by Parallax. Hal Jordan is insecure about his fears and uses his powers for the first time in a party to save the life of people from a Ferris Aircraft helicopter damaged by Hector and later he discloses his identity to his former colleague Carol Ferris, who is the beautiful daughter of Carl Ferris and his love. When Parallax threatens Earth, the Green Lantern Hal Jordan is the last hope to defend his planet from destruction.\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros.

They are imprisoned in the Great Wall and meet the European Ballard, also a mercenary looking for black powder who has been imprisoned in the Great Wall for twenty-five years. Soon they learn that the soldiers are trained specifically to fight monsters called Taotie that attack the humans every sixty years. They are the last outpost protecting the capital. When they suffer attack from the horde of Taoties, William and Tovar also fight helping General Shao and winning his approval. When the Taotie Queen retrieves the horde, they know that they will soon be massively attacked by the Taoties and their only chance is to kill the Queen. Will the humans survive?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn the distant past, a group of European mercenaries are in the Far East in search of the mythical black powder that turns \"air into fire\", it the source of their future wealth in bringing it back to Europe. They are attacked by an unknown creature, with William, one of the mercenaries, able to kill the creature. Two of the mercenaries, William and Tovar, are captured by the local army, called the Nameless Order, who house them within the confines of the Great Wall. The Nameless Order informs them that the creature is called a Tao Tei, as a species who attack once every sixty years, this one specimen killed by William signifying their imminent attack. Tao Tei\'s survival is predicated on the soldier creatures gathering food to bring back to the Queen as nourishment. Although not stated to them explicitly, William and Tovar learn from Ballard, another westerner at the Wall, that they will be treated well but are not allowed ever to leave in the Nameless Order protecting the secrets of the Wall, Ballard who, like them, was a mercenary in search of black powder, he captured twenty-five years ago. As the Tao Tei initiate their attack, the Nameless Order executes their strategic defense, with most of their measures based on their position of the fortress that is the Great Wall. In viewing what is happening, William and Tovar begin to diverge in their thoughts: Tovar, with Ballard, sees the current turmoil as the perfect opportunity to escape stealing as much of the black powder that the Nameless Order has that they can carry, while William, seeing a new purpose in life in learning about trust from Commander Lin Mae, wants to stay and fight with the Nameless Order, it not a certainty that any of them being able to survive regardless of the path they take. This divergence places William and Tovar at odds with each other in carrying out their chosen paths.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:54:12','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C13',13),(148,'1119646','The Hangover','Hangover','The Hangover\r\n¿Qué pasó ayer?\r\nVery Bad Trip\r\nSe Beber, Não Case!\r\nПоследният ергенски запой\r\nLendemain de veille\r\n宿醉\r\nQué pasó Ayer\r\nMamurluk\r\nPařba ve Vegas\r\nTømmermænd i Vegas\r\nPohmakas\r\nKauhea kankkunen\r\nHangover\r\nΤο χανγκόβερ\r\n醉爆伴郎團\r\nMásnaposok\r\nB\'Derekh L\'Khatunah Otzrim B\'Vegas\r\nStopping in Vegas on the Way to a Wedding\r\nUna notte da leoni\r\nHangover!

Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug\'s two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy\'s brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy\'s father\'s beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he\'s with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn\'t be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can\'t find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nTwo days before his wedding with the wealthy Tracy Garner, Doug Billings travels to his bachelor party in Las Vegas with his best friends, the school teacher Phil Wenneck and the dentist Stu Price, and Tracy\'s unconventional brother Alan Garner. Tracy\'s father lends his convertible Mercedez Benz that is his pride and joy to Doug with many recommendations. The quartet rents the best suite in the Caesar\'s Palace and they go to the roof to celebrate. Alan proposes a toast to Doug and they drink his booze. On the next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan have a hangover and they do not recall what they did last night; the room is upside down; Doug is missing; there is a baby in the wardrobe; a tiger in the bedroom; a chicken in the room; Stu has a missing tooth; and Doug is missing. The trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover that Stu married the stripper Jade (heather Graham) and Alan has spiked their booze with \"Good Morning, Cinderella\" in the beginning of their crazy night.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThree friends - Doug Billings, Stu Price, and Phil Wenneck head to Las Vegas for a promising epic bachelor party.

They also find a chicken, a tiger, a random baby, a missing tooth, and a parking stub. As they put together the pieces of the night before they soon realize that there is more to this story than once thought. And did Stu get married to a stripper? And where is Doug?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nIf everything goes according to plan, in less than forty-eight hours, husband-to-be, Doug, will walk down the aisle with his sweetheart, Tracy. Bent on throwing the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties, Doug\'s bosom friends and groomsmen, schoolteacher, Phil, and Stu, the dentist, head to dazzling Las Vegas on a borrowed 1965 Mercedes-Benz 220SE convertible. However, instead of spending a wild night drinking and gambling, the boys, along with Tracy\'s socially inept brother, Alan, wake up in a trashed, $4,200-a-night suite at Caesars Palace, having no recollection of what has happened the night before. Now, as if that weren\'t enough, an incisor is missing, there is a terrifying Bengal tiger in the bathroom, and Doug has vanished into thin air. But, the clock is ticking, and it seems that Doug and Tracy\'s union is just not going to happen. Will those two manage to tie the knot after all?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nJust two days before his marriage with Tracy Garner, Doug Billings, in the company of two friends: Phil Wenneck and Stu Price; and Tracy\'s eccentric brother, Alan, head out to party in Vegas. Driving his father\'s Mercedez, they rent a pricey villa at Caesar\'s and head for the rooftop to have a good time. Three of them later wake up with a hangover, unable to re-collect what exactly happened. With the villa in a wreck, they find that they have a baby in the closet; a grown tiger in the bathroom; Stu has a missing tooth and a hooker for a bride; and Doug is missing. Hilarious chaos results as the trio head out to re-trace their steps as well as try to locate Doug and bring him home in one piece before the wedding.\r\n-\r\nrAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:55:00','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::R18+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::Unrated\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(149,'1428538','Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters','Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters','Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\r\nHansel & Gretel: Cazadores de brujas\r\nHansel e Gretel: Caçadores de Bruxas\r\nJoão e Maria: Caçadores de Bruxas\r\nХензел и Гретел: Ловци на вещици\r\nHansel et Gretel: Chasseurs de sorcières\r\nHansel y Gretel: Cazadores de brujas\r\nIvica i Marica: Lovci na vještice\r\nJenícek a Marenka - Lovci carodejnic\r\nWitch Hunters\r\nNõiakütid Hans ja Grete\r\nHannu ja Kerttu: Noitajahti\r\nHänsel und Gretel: Hexenjäger\r\nHansel kai Gretel: Kynigoi magisson\r\nΧάνσελ και Γκρέτελ: Κυνηγοί μαγισσών\r\nBoszorkányvadászok\r\nKotley ha\'mehashefot\r\nHansel & Gretel - Cacciatori di streghe\r\nHenzeru & Gurêteru\r\nHansel & Gretel\r\nヘンゼル＆グレーテル\r\nAnsītis un Grietiņa: Raganu mednieki\r\nJonukas ir Grytute: raganu medziotojai\r\nHans og Grete\r\nHansel y Gretel: Cazadores de bruja\r\nJaś i Małgosia: Łowcy czarownic\r\nHansel i Gretel: Łowcy czarownic\r\nHansel & Gretel: Caçadores de Bruxas\r\nHansel si Gretel: Vânatorii de vrajitoare\r\nОхотники на ведьм\r\nИвица и Марица - ловци на вештице\r\nJanko a Marienka: Lovci čarodejníc\r\n女巫獵人\r\nHansel ve Gretel: Cadı Avcıları\r\nМисливці за відьмами\r\nHansel & Gretel: Thợ Săn Phù Thủy',2013,88,6.1,202922,'English','United States\r\nGermany','Action\r\nFantasy\r\nHorror','Tommy Wirkola','Tommy Wirkola\r\nJacob Grimm\r\nWilhelm Grimm','Will Ferrell\r\nChristoph Fisser\r\nBeau Flynn\r\nChris Henchy\r\nTracy McCreary\r\nAdam McKay\r\nKevin J.

One day they stumble upon a case that could hold the key to their past.\r\n\r\nSiblings Hansel and Gretel are left alone in the woods by their father and captured by a dark witch in a candy house, but they kill the witch and escape. Years later, the orphans have become famous witch hunters. When 11 children go missing in a small village, the Mayor summons Hansel and Gretel to rescue them, and they save red-haired Mina from the local sheriff who wants to burn her for being a witch. Soon they discover that the Blood Moon will approach in three days and that powerful dark witch Muriel is responsible for all the abductions; she intends to use the children with a secret ingredient in a broth that will protect the coven of witches against the fire. Meanwhile, Hansel and Gretel discover secrets about their parents.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nFifteen years after a horrific experience in a deceptively inviting ginger bread house, an orphan Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) have become famous for ridding the countryside of witches. Despite their stellar success record, the brother and sister face a unique challenge when an extremely powerful witch is identified as the culprit stealing children from a local village with the intent to sacrifice them in an ancient magical ceremony to be held on the night of the Blood Moon. As Hansel and Gretel race against the clock, making several unlikely allies on the way (among them a troll and a witch hunter fanboy), they unexpectedly come across a link to their own pasts and the secret their parents took with them when they disappeared.k.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:55:48','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',18),(150,'0241527','Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone','Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone','Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone\r\nHarry Potter dhe Guri Filozofal\r\nHarry Potter y la piedra filosofal\r\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone\r\nHarry Potter en de steen der wijzen\r\nHarry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal\r\nХари Потър и философският камък\r\nHarry Potter à l\'école des sorciers\r\nHarry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal\r\n哈利·波特与魔法石\r\nHarry Potter i Kamen mudraca\r\nHarry Potter a Kámen mudrců\r\nHarry Potter og de vises sten\r\nHarry Potter ja tarkade kivi\r\nHari Poter I kamen mudrosti\r\nHarry Potter ja viisasten kivi\r\nHarry Potter och de vises sten\r\nHarry Potter und der Stein der Weisen\r\nO Harry Potter kai i filosofiki lithos\r\nΟ Χάρι Πότερ και η φιλοσοφική λίθος\r\nHarry Potter és a bölcsek köve\r\nHarry Potter og viskusteinninn\r\nहैरी पॉटर और पारस पत्थर\r\nHarry Potter va sang-e jadu\r\nHarry Potter e la pietra filosofale\r\nハリー・ポッターと賢者の石\r\nHarijs Poters un filozofu akmens\r\nHaris Poteris ir išminties akmuo\r\nHarry Potter og de vises stein\r\nHarry Potter i Kamień Filozoficzny\r\nХари Потер и Каменот на мудроста\r\nHarry Potter și piatra filosofală\r\nГарри Поттер и философский камень\r\nХари Потер и Камен мудрости\r\nHarry Potter a Kameň mudrcov\r\nHarry Potter in kamen modrosti\r\n해리포터와 마법사의 돌\r\nHarry Potter i la pedra filosofal\r\n哈利波特：神秘的魔法石\r\nHarry Potter ve Felsefe Taşı\r\nГаррі Поттер і філософський камінь\r\nHarry Potter\r\nGarri Potter va hikmatlar toshi\r\nHarry Potter và Hòn Đá Phù Thủy',2001,152,7.6,739597,'English\r\nLatin','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Adventure\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy','Chris Columbus','J.K.

Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.\r\n-\r\nCarly\r\n\r\nHarry Potter is an average bespectacled eleven-year-old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason, the family has always mistreated him. On his eleventh birthday, a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort (Richard Bremmer), a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) thinks he is an ordinary boy celebrating his eleventh birthday, but he is far from right. A giant named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) appears, and gives Harry the all-important news. He is a wizard. Now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. Here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) is not a very brave friend and Hermione (Emma Watson) is the smart friend. But not everything is quiet at Hogwarts as Harry suspects someone is planning to steal the Philosopher\'s/Sorcerer\'s Stone.\r\n-\r\nsimon\r\n\r\nOn his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) discovers that he is no ordinary boy. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), a beetle-eyed giant, tells Harry that he is a wizard and has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In his first year of magical education, Harry tackles a fully grown mountain troll, learns to play Quidditch, and participates in a thrilling \"live\" game of chess.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) thinks that he is an ordinary boy. But on his eleventh birthday, he finally discovered who he really is and he learns that his mum and dad were wizards and witches. Then he realized that he was lucky to survive. Since then, he became a famous person in his new school. In between, a mysterious giant came and gave him a letter telling that he was one of the chosen ones to the school. Therefore he became happy to start a new life and ready to adjust to his new school. As a result, in the school he met two friends, one friend is smart the other one is kind.\r\n\r\nYoung Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has to lead a hard life: His parents have died in a car crash when he was still a baby, and he is being brought up by his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw). For some reason unbeknownst to the bespectacled ten-year-old, the Dursleys let him live in the small chamber under the stairs, and treat him more like vermin than like a family member. His fat cousin Dudley Harry Melling), the Dursley\'s real son, keeps bothering Harry all the time. On his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter finally receives a mysterious letter from a certain Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, telling him that he is chosen as one of the future students of that supposedly renowned school. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the gigantic man who brought the letter, finally introduces Harry into the real circumstances of his life: His parents were a wizard and a witch, they were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort (Richard Bremmer) protecting him. Harry still has a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead from that event. Since he survived the attack as a baby, and also somehow deprived Voldemort from his powers, he has been famous in the wizarding world ever since. The Dursleys, strong disbelievers in that magical crap, never told Harry anything about his true self. So, Harry is strongly surprised, yet absolutely happy to start his training. At Hogwarts, Harry meets his teachers, and becomes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). The three of them accidentally find out that the potions master, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), seems to plot on stealing something that is guarded by a three-headed dog. Since nobody would believe some first years to have found out such important things that even would incriminate a Hogwarts teacher, they take it on themselves to find out what Snape is up to. Their quest for the truth leads across many obstacles, from keeping up the everyday school life, a bewitched Quidditch match (Quidditch is a popular wizard sport), Fluffy, the three-headed monster dog, and quite some tasks one has to overcome to get to the guarded object.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:56:31','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::6\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::SU\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::7\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nThailand::13\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::P',0),(151,'0295297','Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets','Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets','Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\r\nHarry Potter dhe Dhoma e të Fshehtave\r\nHarry Potter y la cámara secreta\r\nHarry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens\r\nHarry Potter en de geheime kamer\r\nHarry Potter e a Câmara Secreta\r\nХари Потър и стаята на тайните\r\nHarry Potter et la chambre des secrets\r\n哈利·波特与密室\r\nHarry Potter i Odaja tajni\r\nHarry Potter a tajemná komnata\r\nHarry Potter og hemmelighedernes kammer\r\nHarry Potter ja saladuste kamber\r\nHari Poter i dvorana tajni\r\nHarry Potter ja salaisuuksien kammio\r\nHarry Potter och hemligheternas kammare\r\nHarry Potter et la Chambre des secrets\r\nO Harry Potter kai i Kamara me ta Mystika\r\nΟ Χάρι Πότερ και η κάμαρα με τα μυστικά\r\nHarry Potter és a titkok kamrája\r\nHarry Potter og leyniklefinn\r\nHairee Pautar aur Rahasyamayee Tahakhaana\r\nHarry Potter va Talar e Asrar\r\nHarry Potter ve\'Khadar Ha\'Sodot\r\nHarry Potter e la camera dei segreti\r\nHarii Pottâ to himitsu no heya\r\nハリー・ポッターと秘密の部屋\r\nHarijs Poters un noslēpumu kambaris\r\nHaris Poteris ir paslapčiu kambarys\r\nHarry Potter og mysteriekammeret\r\nHarry Potter i Komnata Tajemnic\r\nHarry Potter e a Câmara dos Segredos\r\nHarry Potter și Camera Secretelor\r\nГарри Поттер и тайная комната\r\nХари Потер и Дворана тајни\r\nHarry Potter a tajomná komnata\r\nHarry Potter in dvorana skrivnosti\r\nHarry Potter i la cambra secreta\r\nHarry Potter och Hemligheternas kammare\r\n哈利波特：消失的密室\r\nHarry Potter ve Sırlar Odası\r\nГаррі Поттер і таємна кімната\r\nIncident on 57th Street\r\nGarri Potter va maxfiy hujra\r\nHarry Potter y la cámara de los secretos\r\nHarry Potter và Phòng Chứa Bí Mật',2002,161,7.5,605041,'English\r\nLatin','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Adventure\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy\r\nMystery','Chris Columbus','J.K.

Harry and his friends are now forced to secretly uncover the truth about the chamber before the school closes or any lives are taken.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nWhen a crazy house-elf named Dobby (Toby Jones) arrives in Harry\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s) room, he warns him that there is a plot to destroy Hogwarts and that he shouldn\'t return. Harry then starts hearing voices through the walls, students being petrified, and a girl who died in a bathroom. He soon finds out that it is a basilisk roaming in the Chamber Of Secrets, under the control from a memory of Lord Voldemort. Is Voldemort still inactive? Or will it be a friend of his being controlled?\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his second year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is visited by a house-elf named Dobby (Toby Jones), and warned not to go back to Hogwarts. Harry ignores his warning, and returns. He is still famous, although still disliked by Snape (Alan Rickman), Draco (Tom Felton), and the rest of the Slytherins. But then, strange things start to happen. People are becoming petrified, and no one knows what is doing it. Harry keeps hearing a voice, a voice which seems to be coming from within the walls. They are told the story of the Chamber of Secrets. It is said that only Salazar Slytherin\'s true descendent will be able to open it. Harry, it turns out, is a Parsel-tongue. This means that he is able to speak with and understand snakes. Everyone thinks that it\'s him that has opened the Chamber of Secrets because that is what Slytherin was famous for.\r\n-\r\nSarah\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts School of Wizardry for his second year. After a confrontation with a house-elf named Dobby (Toby Jones), Harry escapes to the Weasley house with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) in a flying car. They are then late for the train and have to ride it to school. When they get there, strange happenings invade the school. \"Mudbloods\" (people of Muggle families) are \"petrified\" by an evil monster lurking in the grounds. When everyone suspects that it is Harry, the trio then set out to find the culprit and find out more than they bargained for: the diary of Tom Riddle (Christian Coulson), why Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) was expelled, and what the Chamber of Secrets is, and why is it so feared in Hogwarts.\r\n-\r\nMichael Johnston','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:57:03','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nBulgaria::B\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::9\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::6\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::P',0),(152,'0304141','Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban','Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban','Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter dhe i Burgosuri i Azkabanit\r\nHarry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter en de gevangene van Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban\r\nХари Потър и затворникът от Азкабан\r\nHarry Potter et le prisonnier d\'Azkaban\r\n哈利·波特与阿兹卡班的囚徒\r\nHarry Potter i Zatočenik Azkabana\r\nHarry Potter a vězeň z Azkabanu\r\nHarry Potter og fangen fra Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter ja Azkabani vang\r\nHarry Potter ja Azkabanin vanki\r\nHarry Potter och fången från Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter et le Prisonnier d\'Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban\r\nO Harry Potter kai o aihmalotos tou Azkaban\r\nΟ Χάρι Πότερ και ο αιχμάλωτος του Αζκαμπάν\r\nHarry Potter és az azkabani fogoly\r\nHarry Potter og fanginn frá Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter aur Azkaban Ka Kaidee\r\nPotter va Zendani-ye Azkaban\r\nHarry Potter e il prigioniero di Azkaban\r\nHarii Pottâ to Azukaban no shûjin\r\nハリー・ポッターとアズカバンの囚人\r\nHarijs Poters un Azkabanas gūsteknis\r\nHaris Poteris ir Azkabano kalinys\r\nHarry Potter i więzień Azkabanu\r\nХари Потер и Затвореникот од Азкабан\r\nHarry Potter și prizonierul din Azkaban\r\nГарри Поттер и узник Азкабана\r\nХари Потер и затвореник из Аскабана\r\nHarry Potter a väzeň z Azkabanu\r\nHarry Potter in jetnik iz Azkabana\r\nHarry Potter i el pres d\'Azkaban\r\n哈利波特：阿茲卡班的逃犯\r\nHarry Potter ve Azkaban Tutsağı\r\nГаррі Поттер і в\'язень Азкабану\r\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: The IMAX Experience\r\nHarry Potter y el prisionero de Azkabán\r\nGarri Potter va Azkaban mahbusi\r\nHarry Potter và Tên Tù Nhân Ngục Azkaban',2004,142,7.9,604011,'English\r\nLatin\r\nOld English','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Adventure\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy\r\nMystery','Alfonso Cuarón','J.K.

He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon\'s (Richard Griffiths\') sister Marge (Pam Ferris), who was being offensive towards Harry\'s parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won\'t be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort\'s trusted aide Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile creatures called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nIn the summer before his third year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) becomes fed up with his horrible aunt and uncle, and after accidentally inflating his visiting Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), he runs away. Unfortunately, there\'s much more danger in the wizarding world than Harry thought. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizarding prison Azkaban. Black is known as Lord Voldemort\'s most devoted follower, and he\'s after Harry to avenge Voldemort and finish the job. But not everything is what it seems, and inside of Hogwarts there may just be a traitor.\r\n-\r\nEsamey\r\n\r\n\"He\'s at Hogwarts. He\'s at Hogwarts.\" The infamous Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison and all sources believe he\'s after Harry Potter\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s) life. What connection could there be between Harry\'s past and this crazed murderer? Can Harry figure it out before Black gets to him? And why does Mr. Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) think Harry may want to find Black first? A shocking insight to a night twelve years ago.\r\n-\r\nTrinka\r\n\r\nHarry\'s life is in mortal danger again, this time more than ever. First, a killer named Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison, and it seems that he broke out just to finish what his master wanted to do thirteen years ago: kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Also, for Harry\'s protection, Azkaban has sent hundreds of Dementors to guard Hogwarts in an attempt to catch Black. But will they turn out to be a great help or a big mistake?\r\n-\r\nPrince\r\n\r\nApproaching his third year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has had enough of his muggle relatives. He runs away from them (finally) and enters his third term facing trouble from more than one side: for using magic outside the school and from the news that a notorious criminal, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped the wizard\'s prison at Azkaban and apparently is headed for Harry. The school calls in supernatural help against Black in the form of Dementors, but unusual things continue to put Harry in peril. He is thrown into a confusing panoply of shifting alliegences and shifting shapes where nobody is who or what they seem. Who is the real criminal? What is the real crime?

They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final, but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') \"Death Eaters\" set a fire to all of the visitors\' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort\'s symbol, the \"Dark Mark\" in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting \"The Triwizard Tournament\", a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of seventeen, and are chosen by a magical object called \"The Goblet of Fire\". On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year, where the Triwizard Tournament is soon due to begin. Students must be over seventeen to enter, with the winner receiving eternal glory. Harry can\'t enter it this year, or can he. When his name is read out from the Goblet of Fire, everyone assumes that Harry has cheated. Harry insists that he never placed his name in there, with someone else behind it. But who? Harry must now survive through dragons, sea creatures and a terrifying maze, all before coming face-to-face with a particular dark wizard.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nThe Tri-Wizard Tournament is open. Four champions are selected to compete in three terrifying tasks in order to win the Tri-Wizard Cup. Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is selected by the Goblet of Fire to compete while struggling to keep up the pace with classes and friends. He must confront fierce dragons, aggressive mermaids, and a dark wizard that hasn\'t been able to make his move for thirteen years.\r\n-\r\nMarcus Plush\r\n\r\nHarry\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s) fourth summer and the following year at Hogwarts are marked by the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, in which student representatives from three different wizarding schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') Death Eaters are gaining strength and even creating the Dark Mark giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise again. In the unsuspecting lives of the young wizard and witches at Hogwarts, the competitors are selected by the Goblet of Fire, which this year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have two representatives in the tournament, including Harry Potter. Will Harry be able to rise to the challenge for the Triwizard Tournament while keeping up with school or will the challenges along with Voldemort\'s rebirth be too much for the young hero?\r\n-\r\nimann\r\n\r\nThis installment takes us deeper into the characters\' minds and the darkness of the Wizarding World. At the Quidditch World Cup, Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') followers gather and wreak havoc. Then, at Hogwarts, a legendary event takes place. The Triwizard Tournament. The Goblet of Fire judges who gets in and who doesn\'t. On the fateful night, three champions are selected. But then the Goblet spits out one other, Harry\'s (Daniel Radcliffe\'s). These two major events point to the return of Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) and the other teachers sense it, but it is inevitable. And Harry is no longer safe at Hogwarts.

Few of students and parents believe him or Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is really back. The ministry had decided to step in by appointing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. Harry also can\'t help stealing glances with the beautiful Cho Chang (Katie Leung). To top it off are dreams that Harry can\'t explain, and a mystery behind something for which Voldemort is searching. With these many things, Harry begins one of his toughest years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\r\n-\r\nHPfan\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Hogwarts to begin his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) discovers that much of the wizarding world, including the Ministry of Magic, is in denial about Lord Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes\') return. The Order of the Phoenix, a group sworn against Voldemort, is using its vast array of wizards and witches magical abilities to combat Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), Minister for Magic, suspects that Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) is using these claims of The Dark Lord\'s return as a means to over-throw Fudge as Minister. In retaliation, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is appointed by the Ministry in order to keep an eye on Hogwarts. This new teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), implies strict new teachings and rules, forcing a group of students, under the tutelage of Harry, to form a club, by the name of \"Dumbledore\'s Army\".\r\n-\r\nLoopy Bug\r\n\r\nAs another year begins for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, so do the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) are insane. As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry\'s account of Voldemort\'s return, Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all of the insanity, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students, they begin to find that with her as their teacher, they\'ll never be ready for the outside world. So Harry, along with his friends, decide to take things into their own hands and begin to learn magic the real way. As Harry starts having visions of terrible events happening within the Ministries very walls, he decides to take action, leading himself and his friends into battle, ultimately teaching them what friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice really means.\r\n-\r\nKyle\r\n\r\nAfter a disastrous summer with the Dursleys, including an encounter with the Dementors, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shunned by friends upon returning to Hogwarts, after the return of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and no one believes him. He starts his fifth year while new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) refuses to teach them defensive spells while refuting Harry\'s claims of the Dark Lord\'s return. So Harry sets out, with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), to start up \"Dumbledore\'s Army\" to battle evil forces and prepare the fellow young witches and wizards for the extraordinary journey that lies ahead.\r\n-\r\nMichael Anderson\r\n\r\nIt\'s another year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends. The previous year, he witnessed not just the death of Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), but also the return of the Dark Lord, Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The Ministry of Magic doesn\'t believe everything Harry says and will do anything to keep everyone calm. Hogwarts begins changing, especially when Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) arrives to take over the school. Now, with Voldemort\'s army getting closer, Harry and his friends must teach themselves and form an army to take on the upcoming threat.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 10:58:48','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nBulgaria::B\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',12),(155,'0417741','Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince','Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince','Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\r\nHarry Potter dhe Princi Gjakpërzier\r\nHarry Potter y el misterio del príncipe\r\nHarry Potter et le prince de sang-mêlé\r\nHarry Potter e o Enigma do Príncipe\r\nХари Потър и Нечистокръвният принц\r\n哈利波特与混血王子\r\nHarry Potter i Princ miješane krvi\r\nHarry Potter a Princ dvojí krve\r\nHarry Potter og halvblodsprinsen\r\nHarry Potter ja segavereline prints\r\nHarry Potter ja puoliverinen prinssi\r\nHarry Potter och halvblodsprinsen\r\nHarry Potter et le Prince de sang-mêlé\r\nHarry Potter und der Halbblutprinz\r\nO Harry Potter kai o imiaimos prigips\r\nΟ Χάρι Πότερ και ο ημίαιμος πρίγκιψ\r\n哈利波特－混血王子的背叛\r\nHarry Potter és a félvér herceg\r\nHarry Potter VehaNasich Hatzuy-Hadam\r\nHarry Potter e il principe mezzosangue\r\nHarii Pottâ to nazo no purinsu\r\nハリー・ポッターと謎のプリンス\r\nHarijs Poters un Jauktasiņu Princis\r\nHaris Poteris ir netikras princas\r\nHarry Potter wa al-amir al-hajin\r\nHarry Potter en de halfbloed prins\r\nHarry Potter i Książę Półkrwi\r\nHarry Potter e o Príncipe Misterioso\r\nХари Потер и Полукрвниот Принц\r\nHarry Potter și Prințul Semipur\r\nГарри Поттер и Принц-полукровка\r\nХари Потер и Полукрвни принц\r\nHarry Potter a Polovičný princ\r\nHarry Potter in Princ mesane krvi\r\nHarry Potter i el misteri del príncep\r\nHarry Potter och Halvblodsprinsen\r\n哈利波特：混血王子的背叛\r\nHarry Potter ve melez prens\r\nHarry Potter ve Melez Prens\r\nГаррі Поттер та напівкровний принц\r\nThe Half-Blood Prince\r\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: An IMAX 3D Experience\r\nHarry Potter y el misterio del Príncipe\r\nGarri Potter va Tilsim shahzodasi\r\nHarry Potter và Hoàng Tử Lai\r\nHarry Potter y el misterio del principe\r\nHP and the HBP',2009,153,7.6,518754,'English\r\nLatin','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy\r\nMystery','David Yates','Steve Kloves\r\nJ.K.

Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum\'s \"precious\" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.\r\n-\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, the Kingdom of Erebor in the Lonely Mountain was taken from the dwarfs by the evil dragon Smaug. One day, the young Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is unexpectedly visited by the wizard Gandalf the Grey and twelve homeless dwarfs led by their former king Thorin and decided to vanquish Smaug and recover Erebor and their treasure. Bilbo joins the company in an unexpected journey through dangerous lands of the Middle-Earth where they have to fight against Trolls, Orcs and other magic creatures. Bilbo also meets the Gollum and finds his lost magic ring.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nA well mannered Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, embarks upon a journey to take back a kingdom, and a very important jewel ,with twelve dwarves, and a wizard named Gandalf the Grey. Halfway throughout the journey, Bilbo embarks upon a magic golden ring, which he stole, or earned from Gollum.\r\n\r\nWith his days of adventure and excitement nearly forgotten, the now 111-year-old Bilbo Baggins, has finally settled down for a more conventional, comfortable--and above all--safe way of living in his beloved green Shire. Almost sixty years before the formation of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), a knock at Bilbo\'s door from the wise Gandalf the Grey and an assortment of uncontrollable Dwarves led by King Thorin II Oakenshield prepared the ground for an unexpected quest to help them reclaim their homeland, Erebor. As the Lonely Mountain was taken over by the gargantuan gold-loving dragon, Smaug, this unlikely company would face challenge upon challenge that would later seal the fate of the entire Middle-earth.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nLong before Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) made his arduous journey to Mordor, his brave uncle Bilbo embarked on an adventure for the ages. Bilbo\'s story gets under way when the great wizard Gandalf appears at his front gate with a most unusual offer. Displaced from their massive fortress in the Lonely Mountain by Smaug - a greedy dragon who coveted their gold - a community of noble dwarfs were decimated by a surprise attack by monstrous orcs, whose dreaded leader the Pale Orc slew their king in a gruesome battle. Now, Thorin, the descendant of the king, is determined to reclaim his mountain kingdom for his people. Together with a fearless team of dwarfs, Thorin and Gandalf recruit Bilbo to aid them in their quest since Hobbits have the unique ability to go undetected when they wish to. Before Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarfs can reach The Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug, however, they\'ll have to contend with trolls, goblins, stone giants, Gollum (Andy Serkis), and even the dreaded Pale Orc himself.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:01:52','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(159,'1170358','The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug','Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug','The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\r\nEl Hobbit: La desolación de Smaug\r\nO Hobbit: A Desolação de Smaug\r\nХобит: Пущинакът на Смог\r\nLe Hobbit: La Désolation de Smaug\r\nHobit: Smaugova pustoš\r\nHobit: Šmakova dračí poušť\r\nHobbitten: Dragen Smaugs ødemark\r\nKääbik: Smaugi laastatud maa\r\nHobitti - Smaugin autioittama maa\r\nHobbit - Smaugs ödemark\r\nHobiti: Smaugis aokhrebuli\r\nDer Hobbit - Smaugs Einöde\r\nDer Hobbit: Smaugs Einöde\r\nHobbit: I erimia tou Nosfisti\r\nΧόμπιτ: Η ερημιά του Νοσφιστή\r\nA hobbit: Smaug pusztasága\r\nHobbit: Naboodi-e Smaug\r\nHaHobit: Mapal\'to Shel Smaug\r\nLo Hobbit - La desolazione di Smaug\r\nHobitto: Tatsu ni ubau wareta ôkoku\r\nホビット　竜に奪われた王国\r\nHobits: Smoga posta zeme\r\nHobitas: Smogo dykynė\r\nDe Hobbit: de Woestenij van Smaug\r\nHobbiten: Smaugs ødemark\r\nHobbit: Pustkowie Smauga\r\nHobbit 2: Pustkowie Smauga\r\nHobbitul: Dezolarea lui Smaug\r\nХоббит: Пустошь Смауга\r\nХобит: Шмаугова пустошења\r\nHobit: Smaugova pustatina\r\nHobit: Smaugova pusca\r\nEl hobbit: La desolación de Smaug\r\nHobbit: Smaugs ödemark\r\n哈比人：荒谷惡龍\r\nHobbit: Smaug\'un Çorak Toprakları\r\nХоббіт: Пустка Смога\r\nالهوبيت: خراب سماغ\r\nThe Hobbit Part 2\r\nThere and Back Again Part 2\r\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Extended Edition\r\nHobbit: Smaug vayronasi\r\nHobbit 2\r\nNgười Hobbit: Đại Chiến Với Rồng Lửa\r\nThe Hobbit: Part 2',2013,161,7.8,635373,'English','New Zealand\r\nUnited States','Adventure\r\nFantasy','Peter Jackson','Fran Walsh\r\nPhilippa Boyens\r\nPeter Jackson\r\nGuillermo del Toro\r\nJ.R.R.

If they reach the human settlement of Lake-town it will be time for the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract with the dwarves.

Without the sage wizard\'s guidance, both hobbit and dwarves must keep on venturing into danger undeterred, concentrating solely on their primary mission to retrieve the stolen Arkenstone from Smaug. But atop a mountain of Erebor\'s pilfered gold, the omnipotent drake is waiting silently, ready to put up a fight for his beloved treasure. Who dares to challenge him?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThorin and his company are being pursued by Azog and his Orc party following the events of the previous film. They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skin-changer who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to Galadriel, he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl. Upon entering the forest, the dwarfs lose their way and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired invisibility ring. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:02:15','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',12),(160,'2310332','The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies','Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies','El Hobbit: La batalla de los cinco ejércitos\r\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\r\nHobbit: Besh Ordunun Döyüshü\r\nLe Hobbit: La Bataille des Cinq Armées\r\nO Hobbit: A Batalha dos Cinco Exércitos\r\nХобит: Дотам и обратно\r\nХобит: Битката на петте армии\r\nLe Hobbit: La bataille des cinq armées\r\nEl Hobbit: La Batalla de los Cinco Ejércitos\r\nHobit: Bitka pet vojski\r\nHobit: Bitva pěti armád\r\nHobit: Bitva peti armád\r\nHobbitten: Femhæreslaget\r\nKääbik: Viie väe lahing\r\nHobbit - femhärarslaget\r\nHobitti - Viiden armeijan taistelu\r\nDer Hobbit: Die Schlacht der fünf Heere\r\nHobbit: Ekei kai pali piso\r\nΧόμπιτ: Η μάχη των πέντε στρατών\r\nA hobbit: Az öt sereg csatája\r\nHobbit: Nabard-e panj sepah\r\nHa\'Hobbit: Krav Hameshet Hatsvaot\r\nLo Hobbit - La battaglia delle cinque armate\r\nHobitto kessen no yukue\r\nホビット　決戦のゆくえ\r\nHobits: Piecu armiju kauja\r\nHobitas: Penkių armijų mūšis\r\nDe Hobbit: De Slag van Vijf Legers\r\nHobbiten: Femhærerslaget\r\nHobbit 3: Tam i z powrotem\r\nHobbit, czyli tam i z powrotem\r\nHobbit: Bitwa Pięciu Armii\r\nHobbitul: Bătălia celor cinci oștiri\r\nХоббит: Битва пяти воинств\r\nХобит: Битка пет армија\r\nHobit: Bitka piatich armád\r\nHobit: Bitka petih vojska\r\nEl hobbit: La batalla de los cinco ejércitos\r\nHobbit: Femhäraslaget\r\nHobbit del 3: Femhäraslaget\r\n哈比人：五軍之戰\r\nHobbit: Beş Ordunun Savaşı\r\nХоббіт: Битва п\'яти воїнств\r\nThe Hobbit: There and Back Again\r\nHobbit: Besh qo\'shin jangi\r\nHobbit 3\r\nNgười Hobbit: Đại Chiến Năm Cánh Quân',2014,144,7.4,506736,'English','New Zealand\r\nUnited States','Adventure\r\nFantasy','Peter Jackson','Fran Walsh\r\nPhilippa Boyens\r\nPeter Jackson\r\nGuillermo del Toro\r\nJ.R.R.

The people of Laketown flee to the ruins of Dale, in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain, only to be greeted by an army of Elves led by Thranduil, marching there too. Asking Thorin for their own fair share of the gold, Men and Elves are answered by Dwarvish defiance. Thorin seems overmatched until an army led by Dwarf-Lord Dain, Thorin\'s kinsman, approaches from the Iron Hills to the northeast. Meantime, Gandalf, imprisoned in the ruins of Dol Guldûr, seems about to be finished off by the Nine Ring Wraiths, led by the deadliest of their lot, Witch King of the ancient, evil realm of Angmar. And what on Middle Earth will happen when an enormous army of Orcs and Wargs suddenly pours out of tunnels under the earth, surrounding and threatening doom to all the other armies gathered at the Lonely Mountain? Orcs and their Fell Beasts, Elves, Dwarves, Men - Five Armies join battle, and the result will determine the fate of the North in the gathering War of the Ring.\r\n\r\nAfter seizing Erebor from Smaug, Smaug burns down Lake-town and the aftermath causes the people of Lake-town to take up refuge in the ruins of Dale which is in the shadow of Erebor. Gandalf is inprisoned by The Necromancer and is eventually rescued and The Necromancer reveals himself as Sauron. Bilbo and Company must protect Erebor from the Elves of Mirkwood, the Gundabad and Moria Orcs, the Men of Lake-town.\r\n\r\nAtop the reclaimed Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins and the fellowship of Dwarves witness the mighty winged drake, Smaug, swooping down upon Laketown in a fit of fiery rage, as refugee denizens and Elves converge on Erebor to claim the realm\'s inestimable treasure. However, as Prince Thorin II Oakenshield rapidly succumbs to the hypnotic allure of the corrupting mounds of gold, friendships shatter over greed, and a war is brewing. And just as all races prepare for battle, dark lord Sauron\'s evil forces led by the Orc chieftain, Azog, emerge from the dark bowels of the earth, flanking the vast battlefield, in Middle-earth\'s greatest conflict that will decide everyone\'s future.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:02:35','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',12),(161,'0343818','I, Robot','I, Robot','I, Robot\r\nYo, robot\r\nEu, Robô\r\nАз, роботът\r\nLes robots\r\nJa, Robot\r\nJá, robot\r\nMina, robot\r\nEgo, to robot\r\nΕγώ, το ρομπότ\r\nÉn, a robot\r\nIo, robot\r\nアイ，ロボット\r\nES, ROBOTS\r\nAš - robotas\r\nJa, robot\r\nEu, Robot\r\nEu, Robotul\r\nЯ, робот\r\nЈа, робот\r\nJaz, robot\r\nJo, robot\r\n機械公敵\r\nBen, Robot\r\nЯ, Робот\r\nHardwired\r\nMen, robot\r\nToi, nguoi may',2004,115,7.1,524200,'English','United States\r\nGermany','Action\r\nMystery\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Alex Proyas','Jeff Vintar\r\nAkiva Goldsman\r\nJeff Vintar\r\nIsaac Asimov','Michael Lee Baron\r\nJohn Davis\r\nTopher Dow\r\nWyck Godfrey\r\nJohn Kilkenny\r\nJames Lassiter\r\nLaurence Mark\r\nSteven R.

Unconvinced of the motive, Spooner\'s investigation into Lanning\'s death reveals a trail of secrets and agendas within the USR (United States Robotics) corporation and suspicions of murder. Little does he know that his investigation would lead to uncovering a larger threat to humanity.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nSet in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of \"robotophobic\" Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner\'s investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny , appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there\'s nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.\r\n-\r\nAustin4577@aol.com\r\n\r\nThis is the year 2035. Everybody in the world relies on a huge system of robots, which are programmed specifically to help humans and not harm them in any way. But one person does not think that robots are helpful. Chicago homicide detective Del Spooner. But one day, he received a call from the United States Robotics (USR) about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning. Spooner immediately blamed this incident on robots without justifiable reason or proof. Then, he begins his investigation on Lanning\'s death, only to discover Sonny, a \"unique\" robot. What Spooner does not realize, is that something is about to happen. Something that is beyond even Spooner\'s wildest dreams.\r\n-\r\nJohn Wiggins\r\n\r\nIt\'s the year 2035, and the society now has the help of robots. These robots follow three laws integrated into their system; 1) They cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2)They must do whatever they\'re told by a human being as long as such orders don\'t conflict with law one. 3) They have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn\'t conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently jumps out of a window at U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then it means he would\'ve had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now discover the truth before it\'s too late.\r\n-\r\nRidley Lavine\r\n\r\nIt\'s 2035 A.D., where robots are everyday objects and are programmed to live alongside humans. Detective Del Spooner is called out to investigate the apparent suicide of the scientist behind these robots, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner suspects that the death might not be a suicide, but the result of one of the robots. All robots are programmed by three laws, but Spooner starts to wonder if a robot can in fact feel emotions, and possibly murder. But if Spooner\'s suspicions are true, he is going to have a hard time convincing everyone.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:03:23','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::14\r\nCzechia::12\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::0\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(162,'1418377','I, Frankenstein','I, Frankenstein','I, Frankenstein\r\nYo, Frankenstein\r\nFrankenstein: Entre Anjos e Demônios\r\nАз, Франкенщайн\r\nMoi, Frankenstein\r\nFrankenstein\r\nJa, Frankenstein\r\nJá, Frankenstein\r\nMina, Frankenstein\r\nÉn, Frankenstein\r\nParakkum Kallarai Manithan\r\nAni, Frankenstein\r\nアイ・フランケンシュタイン\r\nEs, Frankenšteins\r\nAs, Frankensteinas\r\nEu, Frankenstein\r\nЯ, Франкенштейн\r\nJa, Frankenštajn\r\nFrankenstein: Ölümsüzlerin Savaşı',2014,92,5.1,80241,'English','United States\r\nAustralia','Action\r\nFantasy\r\nSci-Fi','Stuart Beattie','Stuart Beattie\r\nKevin Grevioux\r\nStuart Beattie\r\nKevin Grevioux\r\nMary Shelley','Matt Berenson\r\nAnne Bruning\r\nKevin Grevioux\r\nDavid Kern\r\nSidney Kimmel\r\nGary Lucchesi\r\nTroy Lum\r\nAndrew Mason\r\nJames McQuaide\r\nEric Reid\r\nTom Rosenberg\r\nJim Tauber\r\nBruce Toll\r\nRichard S.

However he is attacked by demons but he kills one of them and Gargoyles save him and take him to a Cathedral where the Gargoyles Order gathers. The Queen of the Gargoyles Leonore keeps Dr. Frankenstein\'s journal together with the treasures of the Order and gives the name of Adam to the creature. Then she explains to Adam that there is an ancient war between the Gargoyles that are angels and demons under the command of the Prince Naberius. She also invites Adam to join the Gargoyles in the war against demons, but Adam prefers to isolate in a remote place. Two hundred years later, Adam returns and finds a modern society. Soon he learns that Naberius has the intention of creating an army of soulless corpses to be possessed by demons. The scientist Terra is researching a process to create life and Naberius is seeking Dr Frankenstein\'s journal to help Terra and raise his army.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn 1795, Dr. Victor Frankenstein creates a monster, a soulless creature patched together from corpses, and then rejects it, disgusted with what he has made. In a fit of rage, the creature kills Victor\'s wife Elizabeth and Victor chases it to the Arctic to get revenge, but succumbs to the weather. The creature buries his creator in the Frankenstein family cemetery and is then attacked by demons before being rescued by the gargoyles Ophir and Keziah, who bring it before the gargoyle queen Leonore and their commander Gideon. Leonore explains that they were created by the Archangel Michael to battle demons on Earth and protect humanity. They name the creature \"Adam\" and invite him to join them, but he declines and departs after being given heavy, baton-like weapons to protect himself, as more demons will come after him. The weapons allow him to \"descend\" demons (destroying their bodies and trapping their souls in Hell) as they have the symbol of the Gargoyle Order carved on them..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:04:18','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16',12),(163,'0116629','Independence Day','Independence Day','Independence Day\r\nDía de la Independencia\r\nDe dag dat we terugvechten\r\nДенят на независимостта\r\nLe jour de l\'indépendance\r\n独立日\r\nDan nezavisnosti\r\nDen nezávislosti\r\nIseseisvuspäev\r\nIndependence day - världarnas krig\r\nIndependence Day - Maailmojen sota\r\nIndependence Day : Le Jour de la riposte\r\nMera anexartisias\r\nΗμέρα ανεξαρτησίας\r\nΜέρα Ανεξαρτησίας\r\nA függetlenség napja\r\nRooz-e esteghlal\r\nHa-Yom Ha-Shlishi\r\nインデペンデンス・デイ\r\nNepriklausomybes diena\r\nDía de la independencia\r\nDzień Niepodległości\r\nDia da Independência\r\nZiua independentei\r\nДень независимости\r\nДан независности\r\nDeň nezávislosti\r\nDan neodvisnosti\r\nID4星際終結者\r\nKurtuluş Günü\r\nДень незалежності\r\nID4\r\nIndependence Day 3D\r\nMustaqillik kuni\r\nDia de la independencia\r\nNgày Độc Lập',1996,145,7,557142,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','Roland Emmerich','Dean Devlin\r\nRoland Emmerich','Dean Devlin\r\nRoland Emmerich\r\nUte Emmerich\r\nWilliam Fay\r\nPeter Winther','David Arnold','Will Smith\r\nBill Pullman\r\nJeff Goldblum\r\nMary McDonnell\r\nJudd Hirsch\r\nRobert Loggia\r\nRandy Quaid\r\nMargaret Colin\r\nJames Rebhorn\r\nHarvey Fierstein\r\nAdam Baldwin\r\nBrent Spiner\r\nJames Duval\r\nVivica A.

It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles and Washington, as well as Paris, London, Houston and Moscow.

As the extraterrestrial adversary\'s indestructible flying saucers wreak havoc on our planet from end to end killing millions, the end of the human race is near--and what is even more certain--we, the powerless and unprepared earthlings, are utterly defenceless. Once, we dreamed of making contact with otherworldly celestial entities.

Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a society divided into five factions. Each faction represents a different way of handling things. Erudite are the intelligent. Candor the honest. Abnegation the selfless. Amity the kind. Dauntless the brave. The Erudite have declared war against Abnegation, because they believe that they have important information about the Divergent, who are apparently dangerous for the faction-system. Haunted by her past, Tris must make choices that will change her. While running with her boyfriend Four (Theo James)and her brother Caleb(Ansel Elgort) from Erudite, who want to find her, because of her abnormal brain functioning. She and Four seek shelter in various faction headquarters with other Dauntless who have chosen to fight against Erudite\'s self-proclaimed, smug, superiority. Dauntless are plotting against Erudite, with other allies until Erudite begins to kill people if Tris doesn\'t sacrifice herself. Again, Tris must confront her inner demons and make a choice that may change everything. What she doesn\'t realize is that if she sacrificed herself the world they know may change forever.\r\n-\r\nhoney_a\r\n\r\nFive days after the assault on the Abnegation faction by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) and her mind-controlled Dauntless soldiers, Jeanine has declared martial law and that the Divergents and those allied with them are the enemy. Among the Abnegation wreckage, Dauntless leader Eric (Jai Courtney) recovers a five-sided box: each side has a faction symbol. Jeanine presumes it contains data from the city\'s founders and the means to end the Divergence problem. As only a Divergent is capable of opening the box, she orders the capture of all Divergents. 17 year old Tris (Shailene Woodley), Tobias Eaton (Theo James) (also known as Four), Peter (Miles Teller), and Caleb (Ansel Elgort) hide within the Amity compound. Soon after, Eric and his fleet arrive to test all the occupants for Divergence. Peter gives up the group\'s location as Tris, Four, and Caleb escape and board a train headed into Factionless territory. Four reveals to the Factionless that his real name is Tobias Eaton, whom they have been searching for..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:06:27','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(165,'0790724','Jack Reacher','Jack Reacher','Jack Reacher\r\nJack Reacher: O Último Tiro\r\nДжак Ричър\r\nJack Reacher: Bajo la mira\r\nJack Reacher: Poslední výstřel\r\nJack Reacher - Tappajan jäljillä\r\nJack Reacher: Tappajan jäljillä\r\nJack Reacher - La prova decisiva\r\nOutlaw\r\nアウトロー\r\nDžeks Rīčers\r\nDžekas Ryčeris\r\nStretch\r\nJack Reacher: Jednym strzałem\r\nJack Reacher.

The police quickly identify and arrest the culprit, and build a slam-dunk case. But instead of confessing, the accused man writes the words, \"Get Jack Reacher.\" Reacher himself sees the news report and turns up in the city. The defense is immensely relieved, but Reacher has come to bury the guy. Shocked at the accused\'s request, Reacher sets out to confirm for himself the absolute certainty of the man\'s guilt, but comes up with more than he bargained for.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nWhen 5 seemingly random people are shot by a sniper an investigation leads the police to former Army sniper who has a history of shooting people in the streets when he was in the Army. When he meets his lawyer, Alex Rodin, all he tells her is to find Jack Reacher. She learns that Reacher is a former Army Criminal Investigator. Reacher upon hearing the news arrives. He learns Rodin wants him to help her defend the guy but Reacher doesn\'t want to help him. It seems that Reacher was the one who investigated the shootings he committed when he was in the Army but the Army opted not to prosecute. He told the man that if he did it again, Reacher will come after him. Reacher agrees to look into it if Rodin tries to look at the people he killed. She does and Reacher goes to tell her that the shootings were not the man\'s m.o. Reacher suspects someone is framing him. So he and Rodin try to find out why and who.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nWhen a sniper shoots randomly five victims, Detective Emerson finds evidence to incriminate the former paranoid marine James Barr. It is an easy case for the prosecutor Rodin, but Barr refuses to sign the confession and he calls Jack Reacher. When he is transported to prison in a bus, the other prisoners beat him and Barr goes to the hospital in coma. The pacifist attorney Helen Rodin, who is the daughter of the prosecutor, decides to defend him but Jack Reacher is a former military criminal investigator that left the army and has become an unknown drifter. Out of the blue, Jack appears in the city and Helen invites him to work for her investigating the case. Soon he finds that the culprit is innocent and there is a conspiracy behind the murders.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nWhen a crazed sniper guns down five seemingly random people on a crowded Pittsburgh riverfront, Det. Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly amasses enough evidence at the scene to implicate an unstable ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). Upon being questioned by Emerson and DA Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), however, Barr demands to speak with Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). A former military investigator who fell off the grid following his service, Reacher soon shows up on the scene and begins gathering clues with the aid of talented defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the daughter of the DA. Meanwhile, when Reacher is assaulted in a local bar, he correctly surmises that someone is determined to impede his investigation. His theory plays out when he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of a young woman shortly thereafter. Now, with the police closing in from one side and a gang of ruthless killers gaining ground on the other, Reacher must use his formidable detective skills in order to catch the gunman and uncover his true motives.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nAfter claiming the lives of five seemingly unrelated targets in broad daylight, the troubled Iraq War veteran and prime suspect, James Barr, summons the reclusive and highly trained nobody, Jack Reacher. As Jack collaborates with Barr\'s defence attorney, Helen Rodin, before long, the pair of investigators will find themselves dragged into a dangerous multi-faceted conspiracy, run by powerful players who are bent on stopping those who dig around. Will Reacher\'s military background be of any use in this intricate case? Above all, what if the authorities don\'t have the right man?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:07:08','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(166,'0443676','Undisputed 2: Last Man Standing','Undisputed 2: Last Man Standing','Undisputed II: Last Man Standing\r\nO Lutador\r\nO Imbatível 2\r\nNeporazitelný II: Poslední zustává\r\nTeräskehä 2\r\nUn seul deviendra invincible : Dernier Round\r\nUndisputed 2\r\nIceman - Killer im Ring\r\nO kyriarhos tou paihnidiou 2\r\nΟ Κυρίαρχος του Παιχνιδιού 2\r\nVitathatatlan 2.\r\nDeadlock II\r\nLa gran pelea 2\r\nChampion 2\r\nChampion.

Though he knows a little karate, his fighting skills are no match for Cheng, the school bully. Dre finds a friend in Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a maintenance man who is also a martial-arts master. Mr. Han teaches Dre all about kung fu in the hope that Dre will be able to face down Cheng and perhaps win the heart of a pretty classmate named Mei Ying.\r\n\r\n12-year-old Dre Parker could\'ve been the most popular kid in Detroit, but his mother\'s latest career move has landed him in China. Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible.

With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:10:55','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::7+\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::7\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',0),(169,'0107290','Jurassic Park','Jurassic Park','Jurassic Park\r\nJurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros\r\nДжурасик парк\r\nLe parc jurassique\r\nZhuluoji gongyuan\r\n侏罗纪公园\r\nJurski park\r\nJurský park\r\nJurassic Park - Collector\'s Edition\r\nΤζουράσικ Παρκ\r\nJyulogei gungyun\r\nPark Ha-Yura\r\nJurashikku pâku\r\nジュラシック・パーク\r\nJuros periodo parkas\r\nParque jurásico\r\nPark Jurajski\r\nPark jurajski 3D\r\nParque Jurássico\r\nПарк юрского периода\r\nПарк из доба јуре\r\nJyuragi gongwon\r\nParc Juràssic\r\nJurassic Park (Parque Jurásico)\r\n侏儸紀公園\r\nKayıp Dünya\r\nПарк Юрського періоду\r\nJP\r\nJurassic Park 3D\r\nParque Jurásico\r\nCông Viên Kỷ Jura',1993,127,8.1,930644,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Steven Spielberg','Michael Crichton\r\nMichael Crichton\r\nDavid Koepp','Kathleen Kennedy\r\nGerald R.

John Hammond has invited four individuals, along with his two grandchildren, to join him at Jurassic Park. But will everything go according to plan? A park employee attempts to steal dinosaur embryos, critical security systems are shut down and it now becomes a race for survival with dinosaurs roaming freely over the island.\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nOn Isla Nublar, a new park has just been built with genetically engineered dinosaurs. Tragedy strikes when one of the workers is killed by a velociraptor. The founder of the park, John Hammond, (Sir Richard Attenborough) requests Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come to the park and ensure that it is safe. Also joining them are Hammond\'s lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When they reach the island, they are amazed to discover that Hammond has created living dinosaurs. However, at the same time, they all have their doubts. Later, Hammond\'s grandchildren Lex and Tim (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) join the group in a tour of the park. Sattler leaves the tour to take care of an ill triceratops. Soon the power in the park is shut down by computer systems geek Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who wishes to steal embryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer. In the process, many dinosaurs escape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, during a thunderstorm, escapes his paddock and attacks the children, and eats Gennaro. Malcolm is injured and Grant and the children are then lost in the park. Meanwhile, Hammond, Sattler, and the rest of the operations team learn that Nedry (who in the meantime has been killed) has locked up the computer system to cover his tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, the group realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose, and are now on the hunt for the visitors.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nPaleontologists Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler and mathematician Ian Malcolm are among a select group chosen to tour an island theme park populated by dinosaurs created from prehistoric DNA. While the park\'s mastermind, billionaire John Hammond, assures everyone that the facility is safe, they find out otherwise when various ferocious predators break free and go on the hunt.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn high hopes of putting the investors\' minds at ease, John Hammond--the visionary billionaire entrepreneur, and founder of the bio-engineering company, InGen--calls in three experts to witness the wonders of the first-ever dinosaur preserve. There, in the isolated island of Isla Nublar, the visitors\' wide-eyed excitement will soon turn into pure horror, when the palaeontologist, Dr Alan Grant, the palaeobotanist, Dr Ellie Sattler, and the cynical mathematician, Dr Ian Malcolm, come face-to-face with ferocious primaeval reptiles on the loose, after a devastating malfunction. Now, the ultimate apex-predator, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is on the hunt for fresh meat. Can they escape from the terrors of Jurassic Park?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nOn a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park\'s security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:11:53','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::12RA\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMaldives::12+\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::10\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::TV-PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16D',12),(170,'0386140','The Legend of Zorro','Legend of Zorro','The Legend of Zorro\r\nLa leyenda del Zorro\r\nDie Legende des Zorro\r\nLa légende de Zorro\r\nA Lenda do Zorro\r\nЛегендата за Зоро\r\nLegenda o Zorrou\r\nLegenden om Zorro\r\nZorro legend\r\nZorron legenda\r\nO thrylos tou Zorro\r\nΟ θρύλος του Ζορρό\r\nZorro legendája\r\nLa leggenda di Zorro\r\nレジェンド・オブ・ゾロ\r\nZorro leģenda\r\nLegenda apie Zoro\r\nLegenda Zorro\r\nA Lenda de Zorro\r\nЛегенда Зорро\r\nЛегенда о Зороу\r\nLegenda o Zorrovi\r\nLegenda o Zorru\r\nLa llegenda del Zorro\r\n蒙面俠蘇洛2：不朽傳奇\r\nZorro efsanesi\r\nZorro Unmasked\r\nThe Mask of Zorro 2\r\nThe Return of Zorro\r\nZ\r\nZorro 2',2005,129,6,99981,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nRomance\r\nThriller\r\nWestern','Martin Campbell','Roberto Orci\r\nAlex Kurtzman\r\nRoberto Orci\r\nAlex Kurtzman\r\nTed Elliott\r\nTerry Rossio\r\nJohnston McCulley','Gary Barber\r\nRoger Birnbaum\r\nMark Cartier\r\nJohn Gertz\r\nMarc Haimes\r\nAmy Lescoe\r\nLaurie MacDonald\r\nWalter F.

Having spent almost a decade protecting his people and fighting injustice, Alejandro\'s wife, Elena, insists that he gives up the black mask, and become a true father to their eight-year-old son, Joaquin. However, when Elena leaves him for the French count, Armand, it becomes evident that the conceited aristocrat is up to no good. Can Zorro, the legendary defender of the innocent, save both his marriage and the country?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThe legendary Zorro (Antonio Banderas) goes off on another adventure to protect the future of California and its citizens. This time, he fights against evil-doers with the help of his beautiful wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and their precocious young son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso). Don Alejandro de la Vega is torn between two worlds: his life as Zorro, and his life as a family man. After Alejandro once again breaks his promise to stop wearing the mask, Elena leaves him, and soon begins seeing Armand (Rufus Sewell), a haughty French Count. But a mysterious explosion in the desert leads Zorro to believe that there\'s more to Armand than meets the eye, and our hero is intent on finding out what that is. Little does he know, there are others working to uncover certain truths as well.\r\n-\r\namneris21','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:12:58','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nCzechia::U\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous Public\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-7\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::0\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',0),(171,'2802144','Kingsman: The Secret Service','Kingsman: The Secret Service','Kingsman: The Secret Service\r\nKingsman: El servicio secreto\r\nKinqsmen: Gizli Xidmet\r\nKingsman: Serviço Secreto\r\nKingsman: Тайните служби\r\nKingsman: Services secrets\r\nKingsman: el servicio secreto\r\nKingsman: Tajna služba\r\nKingsman: Tajná služba\r\nKingsman: Salateenistus\r\nKingsman: Salainen palvelu\r\nKingsman: I mystiki ypiresia\r\nKingsman: Η μυστική υπηρεσία\r\n皇家特工：間諜密令\r\nKingsman: A titkos szolgálat\r\nKingsman: ha\'shei\'route ha\'khashai\r\nKingsman: Secret Service\r\nキングスマン\r\nKingsman: Slepenais dienests\r\nKingsman.

Hart, blaming himself, returns to London to give Lee\'s widow Michelle (Samantha Womack) and her young son Gary \"Eggsy\" (Alex Nikolov) a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number. Seventeen years later, Eggsy (Taron Egerton), having dropped out of training for the Royal Marines despite his intelligence and capability, has become a chav. After being arrested for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the number. Hart arranges his release. Hart explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a private intelligence service founded by wealthy British individuals who lost their heirs in World War I. Hart, code-named \"Galahad\", explains there is a position available, as Agent \"Lancelot\" was killed by the assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) while trying to rescue Professor James Arnold (Mark Hamill) from kidnappers. Eggsy becomes Hart\'s candidate. Other candidates are eliminated through dangerous training tests run by operative \"Merlin\" (Mark Strong), until only Eggsy and Roxy (Sophie Cookson), a candidate he befriended, are left. Eggsy refuses to complete the final test, shooting a Pug puppy he has raised during the training process (unaware that the gun holds blanks), and Roxy is named the new \"Lancelot\".','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:13:26','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C18',18),(172,'4649466','Kingsman: The Golden Circle','Kingsman: The Golden Circle','Kingsman: The Golden Circle\r\nKingsman: El círculo dorado\r\nKingsman: O Círculo Dourado\r\nKingsman: Златният кръг\r\nKingsman: Le cercle d\'or\r\nKingsman: El Círculo Dorado\r\n王牌特工2：黄金圈\r\nKingsman: Zlatni Krug\r\nKingsman: Zlatý kruh\r\nKingsman: Kuldne ring\r\nKingsman: Kultainen kehä\r\nKingsman: Ο χρυσός κύκλος\r\n皇家特工：金圈子\r\nKingsman: Az Aranykör\r\nKingsman: ma\'agal ha\'zahav\r\nKingsman: Il cerchio d\'oro\r\nキングスマン　ゴールデン・サークル\r\nKingsman: Zelta aplis\r\nKingsman.

On his way home from the tailor shop, he is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), a former Kingsman trainee who lost his arm and vocal chords (but was inadvertently saved by Eggsy) during the Valentine (Samuel L.

Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie\'s cybernetic arm, severed in the skirmish, hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer in Eggsy\'s car. With the information gained, Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), the leader of the world\'s largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle, launches missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and kill all of the agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong).\r\n\r\nWhen the Kingsman headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, their journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the U.S. called \"Statesman\", dating back to the day they were both founded. In a new adventure that tests their agents\' strength and wits to the limit, these two elite secret organizations band together to defeat a ruthless common enemy, in order to save the world, something that\'s becoming a bit of a habit for Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Taron Egerton).\r\n-\r\nTwentieth Century Fox','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:13:53','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+R\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C18',18),(173,'3315342','Logan','Logan','Logan\r\nLogan - The Wolverine\r\nЛоган: Върколакът\r\n金刚狼3：殊死一战\r\nLogan: Wolverine\r\nLogan: The Wolverine\r\nΛόγκαν\r\nLogan - Farkas\r\nLogan Noir\r\nLOGAN ローガン\r\nLogans\r\nLoganas.

But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.\r\n\r\nIn 2029 the mutant population has shrunken significantly due to genetically modified plants designed to reduce mutant powers and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan, whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because they made her, with Logan\'s DNA. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over.\r\n\r\nIn the not-so-distant 2029, the entire mutant race is almost obliterated, and Logan, the invincible bestial superhero once known as the Wolverine, finds himself getting old, and his incredible healing ability significantly weakened. As an incognito limo driver, Logan does his best to guard and keep out of sight a weary nonagenarian Professor Xavier; however, things will take an unexpected turn when a cryptic woman asks him to transport the young mutant girl, Laura. A better future lies past the Canadian borders for the unaccompanied teenager, but the government is unwilling to let go of its asset so easily. In the end, can the ageing Logan protect both himself and Laura?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn a dystopian 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan\'s healing ability has weakened and he has physically aged. The Adamantium coating on his skeleton has begun to leach into his body, poisoning him. Hiding in plain sight, Logan spends his days working as a limo driver in El Paso, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker Caliban care for 90-year-old Charles Xavier, Logan\'s mentor and founder of the X-Men. Charles, a telepath, has developed a form of dementia that causes him to have seizures unless controlled with medication. It is alluded that a seizure one year prior, releasing a destructive wave of his telepathic powers, had killed seven mutants, thus leaving the three (Logan, Charles, Caliban) as the last of the X-Men.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:14:33','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::17\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+R\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C18',18),(174,'1210819','The Lone Ranger','Lone Ranger','The Lone Ranger\r\nEl Llanero Solitario\r\nEl llanero solitario\r\nO Cavaleiro Solitário\r\nСамотният рейнджър\r\nThe Lone Ranger, le justicier masqué\r\nUsamljeni osvetnik\r\nOsamelý jezdec\r\nUljas ratsanik\r\nLone Ranger, naissance d\'un héros\r\nLone Ranger\r\nO monahikos kavalaris\r\nΟ μοναχικός καβαλάρης\r\nA magányos lovas\r\nHa\'parash ha\'boded\r\nRôn Renjâ\r\nローン・レンジャー\r\nЖалгыз рейнджер\r\nVientuļais reindžers\r\nVienišas klajunas\r\nJeździec znikąd\r\nO Mascarilha\r\nLegenda calaretului singuratic\r\nОдинокий рейнджер\r\nUsamljeni rendžer\r\nOsamelý jazdec\r\nOsamljeni jezdec\r\n獨行俠\r\nMaskeli Süvari\r\nСамотній рейнджер\r\nKỵ Sĩ Cô Độc',2013,150,6.4,229732,'English\r\nNorth American Indian','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nWestern','Gore Verbinski','Justin Haythe\r\nTed Elliott\r\nTerry Rossio\r\nTed Elliott\r\nTerry Rossio\r\nJustin Haythe','Jerry Bruckheimer\r\nJohnny Depp\r\nMorgan Des Groseillers\r\nEric Ellenbogen\r\nTed Elliott\r\nTom Engelman\r\nShari Hanson\r\nEric McLeod\r\nChad Oman\r\nMelissa Reid\r\nTerry Rossio\r\nPat Sandston\r\nMike Stenson\r\nGore Verbinski','Hans Zimmer','Johnny Depp\r\nArmie Hammer\r\nWilliam Fichtner\r\nTom Wilkinson\r\nRuth Wilson\r\nHelena Bonham Carter\r\nJames Badge Dale\r\nBryant Prince\r\nBarry Pepper\r\nMason Cook\r\nJD Cullum\r\nSaginaw Grant\r\nHarry Treadaway\r\nJames Frain\r\nJoaquín Cosio\r\nDamon Herriman\r\nMatt O\'Leary\r\nW.

They use three gifted humans (called \"Pre-Cogs\") with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system\'s flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn\'t even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery\'s core by finding out the \'minority report\' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that \"might\" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra\r\n\r\nIt is the near future, a future where murders have become so common, that a system had to be established. This system is called \"Precrime\", where 3 psychics can predict murders before they happen. Allowing police to stop the murders. This system is in production in Washington D.C. Where police officer John Anderton (who lost his son to a murder 6 years previous) has stopped numerous murders in his career. One day, he found out that he is the next person to commit a murder. Now, he is running away from a system he helped become successful, and trying to find out why he was set up to commit murder.\r\n-\r\nJohn Wiggins\r\n\r\nWith the extraordinary ability to foresee and, therefore, stop crimes before they can take place, founder Lamar Burgess\' experimental but highly effective Pre-Crime Division has managed to push the murder rate to zero. Indeed, with the aid of the indispensable Pre-cognitives, a trio of humans with acute extrasensory abilities under government custody, there hasn\'t been a single crime in 2054 Washington DC for the past six years; however, of all people, Burgess\' right-hand man, Captain John Anderton, seems to be a pre-criminal. Now, on the run from the law for a homicide he is yet to commit in less than thirty-six hours, Detective Anderton has to use every trick in the book to prove his innocence, and clear his name. But, in Burgess\' state-of-the-art system, there is no such thing as a mistake. Nevertheless, could the psychic triad be wrong?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn 2054, the PreCrime Police Department commanded by Chief John Anderton reduces the crime rates in the violent Washington to zero, using a system based on three humans called Precogs designed by Dr. Iris Hineman to the company owned by Director Lamar Burgess. Anderton is addicted in drugs since her lost his son in a swimming pool and separated from his wife Lara Lara Clarke and was recruited by Burgess to run the department. The Precogs are mutants led by Agatha and capable to foresee crimes in the near future. The agent from the Department of Justice Danny Witwer comes to PreCrime to audit the system and out of the blue, the PreCogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder. He flees and becomes a fugitive while he tries to prove that he is innocent. But is the system fallible?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIt is the year 2054 - Washington D.C. - dreams can be recreated through computers, computer monitors and displays are transformed into holograms, and identification is done through eye-scanning. John Anderton lost his son, and to prevent horrible events from occurring to other individuals he joins a unit known as \"Pre-Crime\" - where murderers are arrested before they can commit the murder. How does Pre-Crime work? Through 3 people known as \"precogs\". They are 3 psychics used to see the future and they see murders exactly the way they will occur. Through advanced technology, Pre-Crime officers are able to see what the precogs see, and they analyze the data, identify the perpetrator and victim, and try their best to stop the murder from occurring. The perpetrator is put into a sleep state with a device called a \"halo\". John Anderton gets accused of murdering a man he has never even met, causing him to run from Pre-Crime and prove his innocence.\r\n-\r\nDemijan Omeragic \"Nuh\"','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:17:45','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(178,'1571234','Mortal Engines','Mortal Engines','Mortal Engines\r\nMáquinas mortales\r\nMortal Engines - Krieg der Städte\r\nMáquinas Mortais\r\nСмъртоносни машини\r\nMécaniques fatales\r\nLue Shi Cheng Shi\r\nSmrtelné stroje\r\nΦονικές μηχανές\r\nRagadozó városok\r\n\'Arei Terref\r\nMacchine mortali\r\n移動都市 モータル・エンジン\r\nIzsalkusī pilsēta\r\nMirtingos mašinos\r\nZabójcze maszyny\r\nEngenhos Mortíferos\r\nMasinarii infernale\r\nХроники хищных городов\r\nSmrtonosne mašine\r\nSmrteľné stroje\r\n移動城市：致命引擎\r\nÖlümcül Makineler\r\nСмертні машини\r\nCỗ Máy Tử Thần',2018,128,6.1,121199,'English','United States\r\nNew Zealand\r\nJapan','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFantasy\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Christian Rivers','Fran Walsh\r\nPhilippa Boyens\r\nPeter Jackson\r\nPhilip Reeve','Philippa Boyens\r\nDavid Conley\r\nDeborah Forte\r\nPeter Jackson\r\nKen Kamins\r\nCarlos Ramírez Laloli\r\nPamela Silverstein\r\nAmanda Walker\r\nFran Walsh\r\nZane Weiner','Junkie XL','Hera Hilmar\r\nRobert Sheehan\r\nHugo Weaving\r\nJihae\r\nRonan Raftery\r\nLeila George\r\nPatrick Malahide\r\nStephen Lang\r\nColin Salmon\r\nMark Mitchinson\r\nRegé-Jean Page\r\nMenik Gooneratne\r\nFrankie Adams\r\nLeifur Sigurðarson\r\nKahn West\r\nAndrew Lees\r\nSophie Cox\r\nKee Chan\r\nSarah Peirse\r\nMark Hadlow\r\nCaren Pistorius\r\nPoppy Macleod\r\nJoel Tobeck\r\nTerry Norris\r\nCalum Gittins\r\nMegan Edwards\r\nPeter Rowley\r\nAaron Jackson\r\nStephen Ure\r\nNathaniel Lees\r\nPaul Yates\r\nLynda Lester\r\nNick Blake\r\nBeatrice Brophy\r\nThomas La Hood\r\nSimbarashe Matshe\r\nLee Tuson\r\nJason Whyte\r\nMichael Homick\r\nCarter Nixon\r\nRick Baker\r\nRoyden Davys\r\nRichard Mills\r\nShane Rangi\r\nYoson An\r\nPhilip Reeve\r\nSam Reeve\r\nNicholas Quirke\r\nMartin Kwok\r\nSeth F.

A year later, they are the Four Horsemen, big time stage illusionists who climax their sold-out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts F.B.I.

However, this mystery proves to be difficult to solve, even with the insights of professional illusion exposer Thaddeus Bradley.

One year later, they reappear as The Four Horsemen in a show in Las Vegas sponsored by the millionaire Arthur Tressler, and they heist a bank in Paris from the stage, and distribute the money to the audience. F.B.I. Agent Dylan Rhodes is assigned to the case and Interpol sends agent Alma Dray to be his partner. Dylan and Alma are completely lost in the investigation, and exposer of illusionists Thaddeus Bradley gives hints about illusion. When the Four Horsemen steal the bank account of Arthur Tressler during a show in New Orleans, Dylan and Alma believe that these heists are only a distraction for a huge scheme, but they are never sure about of what is true, and what is illusion.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nFour down-on-their-luck magicians are brought together by an anonymous person who gives them the blueprints to a great illusion. A year later, they call themselves \"The Four Horsemen\", and the finale of their show is that they will rob a bank. The bank they choose to rob is in France, and they do it. The incident is brought to the attention of the F.B.I., so they assign Agent Dylan Rhodes to investigate. Alma Vargas, an Interpol Agent comes to help Rhodes, which he doesn\'t like. They turn to Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician, who exposes magic as simple trickery. Bradley shows them how they did it, but still not enough to give Rhodes grounds to arrest them. So they follow them and they pull another stunt, which makes Rhodes think that they\'re part of a plot to get back at certain people.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nA team of talented illusionists called \"The Four Horsemen\" (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco) are investigated by a resolute F.B.I.

Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris, the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta, to leave her husband, Menelaus, and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans.

Sam spends his time moping over his father\'s disappearance and pulling a prank on the board. One day, Alan Bradley, his father\'s best friend tells Sam that he got a page from the phone at his father\'s office at his arcade. Sam wonders why is that so important, Alan tells him because the number\'s been disconnected for 20 years. Alan still clings to the hope that Flynn is out there and that he didn\'t walk away from his work and Sam, he gives Sam the keys to the arcade. Sam goes there and finds his father\'s work station and after entering a few codes finds himself in the Grid. After being mistaken for a program, he finds himself subjected to all sorts of contests but when they discover he is not a program but a user. He is brought to the head man whom Sam thinks is his father but later discovers that it\'s CLU and he makes Sam take part in a light cycle battle. Sam is saved by a program named Quorra who takes him to his father. That\'s where he tells Sam that CLU turned on him and was planning to enter their world to \"fix\" it\'s imperfections, so to stop him he closed the portal trapping himself there which is why he never came back. Sam wants to go back but Flynn doesn\'t want to give CLU the chance to carry out his plan, so he chooses not to but Sam defies him.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nThe Master Control Program is booted back up in this revamped Tron continuation that sees the return of original star Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, the brilliant computer programmer whose disappearance leads his son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund), to search for him in and out of the computer world.\r\n\r\nAt the peak of his brilliant career, the ingenious computer programmer, Kevin Flynn, mysteriously disappears, leaving behind his wide-eyed only son, Sam.

But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past.

To that end, former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket is reactivated as part of a desperate plan to destroy the portal. As Raleigh strives to heal his inner scars and help his new partner conquer hers, an intrepid scientist discovers a way to link to the Kaiju\'s mind to learn about them.

So all the heads of the nations decide to stop the program and to try other tactics. But Pentecost the man in charge of the Jaeger program decide to continue the program. He recruits Raleigh Becket a former Jaeger pilot who left after his co-pilot who\'s also his brother died. He tries to find a compatible co-pilot and when he finds no one, he gives Pentecost\'s assistant, a girl named Mako a chance. And when she proves to be the best, he wants her but Pentecost doesn\'t think she\'s ready. And when they try to hook up with their Jaeger, he sees what she\'s been through, which is what Pentecost was worried about. In the meantime, one of the scientists working on how to defeat the Kaijus thinks he found a way but he needs an actual Kaiju brain so Pentecost sends him to see a man who uses Kaiju remains to make a profit, so that he could get a Kaiju brain.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nWhen Earth is invaded deep beneath the Pacific Ocean from a portal between dimensions in a breach by creatures called Kaijus, the governments join forces and realize that only monsters could destroy the Kaijus.

If Jack can\'t find a way to rid himself of Davy Jones once and for all, it may just spell the end for the three adventurers\r\n-\r\nAaliyah Winchester','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:27:52','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChina::17\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::14\r\nIndia::12+\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13',13),(189,'0449088','Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\'s End','Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\'s End','Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\'s End\r\nPiratas del Caribe - En el fin del mundo\r\nPiratas do Caribe: No Fim do Mundo\r\nКарибски пирати: На края на света\r\nPirates des Caraïbes: Jusqu\'au bout du monde\r\n加勒比海盗3：世界的尽头\r\nPirati s Kariba: Na kraju svijeta\r\nPiráti z Karibiku: Na konci světa\r\nPirates of the Caribbean - Ved verdens ende\r\nKariibi mere piraadid: Maailma lõpus\r\nPirates of the Caribbean: Maailman laidalla\r\nPirates des Caraïbes : Jusqu\'au bout du monde\r\nPirates of the Caribbean - Am Ende der Welt\r\nFluch der Karibik - Am Ende der Welt\r\nOi peirates tis Karaivikis - Sto telos tou kosmou\r\nΟι πειρατές της Καραϊβικής: Στο τέλος του κόσμου\r\nA Karib-tenger kalózai: A világ végén\r\nSamundar ke Lutere - Antim Ghadi\r\nShodedey ha\'Caribiyim: sof ha\'olam\r\nPirati dei Caraibi - Ai confini del mondo\r\nPirates of Caribbean: World End\r\nパイレーツ・オブ・カリビアン　ワールド・エンド\r\nKarību jūras pirāti: pasaules malā\r\nKaribu piratai: pasaulio pakrašty\r\nPiraci z Karaibów: Na krańcu świata\r\nPiratas das Caraíbas - Nos Confins do Mundo\r\nPirații din Caraibe: La capătul lumii\r\nПираты Карибского моря: На краю света\r\nПирати са Кариба: На крају света\r\nPiráti Karibiku: Na konci sveta\r\nPirati s Karibov: Na robu sveta\r\nPiratas del Caribe: En el fin del mundo\r\nPirates of the Caribbean: Vid världens ände\r\n加勒比海盗－ 神鬼奇航：世界的盡頭\r\nKarayip Korsanları: Dünyanın Sonu\r\nПірати Карибського моря: На краю світу\r\nP.O.T.C. 3\r\nPirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End\r\nPirates of the Caribbean 3\r\nPirates 3\r\nKarib dengizi qaroqchilari: Dunyoning chegarasida\r\nKarib dengizi qaroqchilari 3\r\nKarib dengizi qaroqchilari: Dunyo chekkasida\r\nCướp Biển Vùng Caribê: Nơi Tận Cùng Thế Giới',2007,169,7.1,625313,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFantasy','Gore Verbinski','Ted Elliott\r\nTerry Rossio\r\nTed Elliott\r\nTerry Rossio\r\nStuart Beattie\r\nJay Wolpert','Jerry Bruckheimer\r\nBruce Hendricks\r\nJack Kney\r\nPeter Kohn\r\nEric McLeod\r\nChad Oman\r\nPat Sandston\r\nMike Stenson\r\nBrigham Taylor','Hans Zimmer','Johnny Depp\r\nGeoffrey Rush\r\nOrlando Bloom\r\nKeira Knightley\r\nJack Davenport\r\nBill Nighy\r\nJonathan Pryce\r\nLee Arenberg\r\nMackenzie Crook\r\nKevin McNally\r\nDavid Bailie\r\nStellan Skarsgård\r\nTom Hollander\r\nNaomie Harris\r\nMartin Klebba\r\nDavid Schofield\r\nLauren Maher\r\nDermot Keaney\r\nClive Ashborn\r\nWinston Ellis\r\nChristopher Adamson\r\nAndy Beckwith\r\nJonathan Linsley\r\nChow Yun-Fat\r\nKeith Richards\r\nGhassan Massoud\r\nHakeem Kae-Kazim\r\nDominic Scott Kay\r\nVanessa Branch\r\nReggie Lee\r\nMarshall Manesh\r\nAngus Barnett\r\nGiles New\r\nTakayo Fischer\r\nMarcel Iures\r\nSergio Calderón\r\nJames Lancaster\r\nToru Tanaka Jr.\r\nEdwin R.

Beckett, now with control of Jones\' heart, forms a dark alliance with him in order to rule the seas and wipe out the last of the Pirates. Now, Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma, and crew must call the Pirate Lords from the four corners of the globe, including the infamous Sao Feng, to gathering. The Pirate Lords want to release the goddess Calypso, Davy Jones\'s damned lover, from the trap they sent her to out of fear, in which the Pirate Lords must combine the 9 pieces that bound her by ritual to undo it and release her in hopes that she will help them fight. With this, all pirates will stand together and will make their final stand for freedom against Beckett, Jones, Norrington, the Flying Dutchman, and the entire East India Trading Company.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nElizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Captain Barbossa go to Singapore to get a ship and crew with the despicable Captain Sao Feng to rescue Jack Sparrow from the land of the dead.

This leads to a dramatic climax as Tia - who is really Calypso, Davy Jones\' lover - unleashed a storm, and the two ships - the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, commanded by Elizabeth (the new pirate \"king\" thanks to Jack) and Davy Jones respectectly.\r\n-\r\nAdam Hillman\r\n\r\nAfter losing Jack Sparrow to the locker of Davy Jones, the team of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Barbossa make their final alliances with the pirate world to take on the forces of Lord Cutler Beckett and his crew, including Davy Jones, who he now has control over.

Even though he is looking to avoid trouble, trouble has a way of finding him: a group of Christian human rights missionaries, led by Michael Burnett and Sarah Miller, approach Rambo with the desire to rent his boat to travel up the river to Burma. For over fifty years, Burma has been a war zone. The Karen people of the region, who consist of peasants and farmers, have endured brutally oppressive rule from the murderous Burmese military and have been struggling for survival every single day. After some inner contemplation, Rambo accepts the offer and takes Michael, Sarah, and the rest of the missionaries up the river. When the missionaries finally arrive at the Karen village, they find themselves part of a raid by the sadistic Major Pa Tee Tint and a slew of Burmese army men. A portion of the villagers and missionaries are tortured and viciously murdered, while Tint and his men hold the remainder captive. Concerned by their disappearance, the minister in charge of the mission gathers a group of mercenaries and pleas Rambo transport them with his boat, since he knows their last exact location. But Rambo can\'t stay behind: he joins the team where he belongs, to liberate the survivors from the clutches of Major Tint in what may be one of his deadliest missions ever\r\n-\r\nstallonezone.com / Drew Lahat\r\n\r\nIn this latest Rambo installment, John Rambo has retreated to a simple life in a rural Thai village near the Burmese border, capturing snakes for local entertainers, and transporting roamers in his old PT boat. Following repeated pleas, Rambo helps ferry a group of Christian aid workers into war-torn Burma, where the local Karen villagers are regularly tortured and massacred by Major Tint\'s sadistic soldiers. The humanitarian mission is going well, until the village is attacked and the missionaries are kidnapped, and Rambo is once again asked to transport - but this time a group of mercenaries, assembled by the missionaries\' minister on a deadly rescue mission. This time he doesn\'t stay behind.\r\n-\r\nDrew Lahat\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, John Rambo is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. When a group of Christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in Burma to help the locals, the reluctant Rambo only accepts when Sarah Miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission. Rambo leaves the group in the requested location, but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of Major Pa Tee Tint, the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted. Later a member of their church meets Rambo and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, John Rambo is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. But when he joins a group of mercenaries to venture into war-torn Burma, and rescue a group of Christian aid workers who were kidnapped by the ruthless local infantry unit. Rambo refuses, but is convinced by another member, Sarah Miller, to take them up there. When the aid workers are captured by the Burmese army, Rambo decides to venture alone into the war zone to rescue them.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\r\n\r\nLiving peacefully somewhere in the green jungles of Thailand, nearly two long decades after the Afghan rescue mission in Rambo III (1988), the unstoppable killing machine, John Rambo, seems to have managed to put the bloodshed of war behind him. However, everything is about to change, when a dauntless team of optimistic missionaries gets captured in war-torn Burma by the vicious militia of the ruthless officer, Major Pa Tee Tint. Now, John has to go back into the mouth of Hell, on a life-or-death operation to save the condemned hostages. Wherever Rambo goes, carnage follows.

A struggling ex-boxer feels he\'s found a champion in a discarded robot.\r\n\r\nIn the near future when people become uninterested in boxing and similar sports, a new sport is created - Robot boxing wherein robots battle each other while being controlled by someone. Charlie Kenton, a former boxer who\'s trying to make it in the new sport, not only doesn\'t do well, he is very deeply in the red. When he learns that his ex, mother of his son Max, dies, he goes to figure out what to do with him. His ex\'s sister wants to take him in but Charlie has first say in the matter. Charlie asks her husband for money so he can buy a new Robot in exchange for turning Max over to them. He takes Max for the summer. And Max improves his control of his robot. But when the robot is destroyed, they go to a scrap yard to get parts. Max finds an old generation robot named Atom and restores him. Max wants Atom to fight but Charlie tells him he won\'t last a round. However, Atom wins. And it isn\'t long before Atom is getting major bouts. Max gets Charlie to teach Atom how to fight, and the father and son bond strenghtens.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIn 2020, boxing is no longer fought by humans, but they have been replaced by robots. The former boxer Charlie Kenton drives his truck to promote fights with his robot Ambush. When he has just lost a fight, he is summoned to a hearing and forced to take care of his unknown eleven year-old son Max Kenton since his mother has passed away. Charlie loses another fight with the Noisy Boy robot that his girlfriend Bailey Tallet has just bought and he goes with Max to a junkyard to collect parts of robots to build a new one. However, Max finds an old sparring robot named Atom and Charlie teaches him how to box. Atom becomes a winner and Max and Charlie become closer to each other. However, Charlie has an agreement to deliver Max to his aunt and her wealthy husband.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nPeople have got rid of boxing and have created robot boxing. A person whose into robot boxing, Charlie Kenton, starts off with a fight with his robot Ambush and he\'s facing Blackthunder the bull. In an attempt to win, Charlie fails and owes lots of money to Ricky. Then, he has to take care of an 11-year old called Max after his aunt has left for the summer. Max\'s uncle gives Charlie some money to buy a Japanese robot called Noisy Boy. Charlie takes Noisy Boy to fight Midas and fails again. But, when Charlie and Max go to the junkyard to clear the parts off of Noisy Boy, Max finds a robot called Atom after slipping off a cliff. However, when Max wins so many fights with Atom, he just might be able to defeat the king of the robots, Zeus.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, boxing is no longer participated by humans. Instead, robots will fight in the ring. A former boxer Charlie Kenton tries to find a good robot after he finds out his wife died and he had lost twice. When he decided to look for parts in the junkyard, his 11 year old son, Max Kenton finds a dumped robot Atom and says he could be a good candidate however Charlie did not agree with him. But Max decided that Atom could so he restored him and he had won many rounds to WRB (World Robot Boxing). And for the final proof that Atom is good, he had to fight the undefeatable WRB champion, Zeus.\r\n-\r\nAken Purnomo\r\n\r\nIn the near future, robots have taken over for humans in the boxing ring.

When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nSet in 1820s America, fur trapper and Frontiersman Hugh Glass struggles to survive the harsh winter after an oppressive Ree Indian attack and a mauling from a hostile maternal bear. Abandoned by his crew, Glass attempts to cross the bleak wasteland with only a single notion set in his mind; Revenge.\r\n\r\nIn the untamed and unforgiving wilderness of mid-winter snow-capped Missouri, the experienced nineteenth-century tracker, Hugh Glass, and his son, Hawk, lead a hunting and trapping expedition in the uncharted territory of the fierce Indian tribe, Arikara. As the party of trappers struggle to navigate back to the distant Fort Kiowa, a swift and devastating attack by a formidable grizzly bear leaves a brutally mauled Glass on the brink of death, double-crossed and abandoned by his men. Now, only Hugh\'s rabid desire to live can help him survive the piercing cold and the grave dangers in one of the world\'s most inhospitable environments, giving him the strength to drag his unrecognisable carcass and exact his revenge. However, will the man who has returned from the dead taste the ambrosial fruit of retribution?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\n1823, half-blood Hugh Glass guides Captain Andrew Henry\'s company trappers party through the present-day Dakotas. While he and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk hunt, the company\'s camp is attacked and decimated by an Arikara war party which seeks its Chief\'s abducted daughter, Powaqa. The surviving trappers escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, who is questioned by some trappers, they next reach on foot Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver would make them vulnerable. After docking, they stashes the pelts. While scouting game, Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear and left presumably dying. Trapper John Fitzgerald fears another Arikara attack, argues they must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry offers money for two men to stay with Glass and bury him after he dies: the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, yet Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts. After the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk, whom he soon after fatally steps while Bridger is gathering water, stabs Hawk to death . Fitzgerald convinces unsuspecting Bridger that the Arikara are approaching, so they must abandon Glass. Bridger ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave, leaving his canteen. Later Fitzgerald admits the lie. When they meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Glass begins his arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude cauterization of his wounds, eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into rapids and teams up with Pawnee refugee Hikuc, sharing bison meat. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in it, Glass emerges as his wounds are healing but Hikuc has been hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and frees raped Powaqa, kills several hunters and recovers Hikuc\'s horse. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives by eviscerating the horse to shelter in its carcass. A French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa, and Bridger recognizes his spiral engraved canteen as Glass\'s, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald empties the outpost\'s safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders the arrest of Bridger, but Glass vouches that he was not present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk and was later deceived and threatened by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. After Glass and Henry split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills and scalps Henry. Glass finds Henry\'s corpse, places it on his horse as a decoy, shoots Fitzgerald in the arm and pursues him Fitzgerald to a riverbank where Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but he spots a band of Arikara downstream and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara (who found Powaqa) spare Glass. Glass retreats into the mountains.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:37:44','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(200,'2126355','San Andreas','San Andreas','San Andreas\r\nTerremoto: La Falla de San Andrés\r\nTerremoto: A Falha de San Andreas\r\nСан Андреас\r\nTerremoto: La falla de San Andrés\r\nTerremoto: la falla de San Andrés\r\nSan Andreas: Επικίνδυνο ρήγμα\r\nTörésvonal\r\nसैन एंड्रीअस\r\nCalifornia Down\r\nカリフォルニア・ダウン\r\nSanandreasa lūzums\r\nDezastrul din San Andreas\r\nРазлом Сан-Андреас\r\nZemljotres u San Andreasu\r\nPrelomnica svetega Andreja\r\nSan Andrés\r\n加州大地震\r\nSan Andreas Fayı\r\nРозлом Сан-Андреас\r\nSan Andreas zilzilasi\r\nKhe Nứt San Andreas',2015,114,6.1,229277,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nThriller','Brad Peyton','Carlton Cuse\r\nAndre Fabrizio\r\nJeremy Passmore','Bruce Berman\r\nRichard Brener\r\nSamuel J.

As Hayes warns on TV, the persisting parameters indicate the whole San Andreas Fault is going to quake as badly, wrecking metropolises LA and San Francisco.

But when Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave and resumes his killing spree, Holmes must take up the hunt once again.

Soon, all of London is atwitter with the news that Blackwood has risen from the dead and for some, he is the devil incarnate.

However, evil knows no boundaries--and as the disquieting rumours that the fiendish practitioner of the black arts has eluded death start to spread like wildfire--a mysterious copycat picks up where the deceased aristocrat left off. Now, against the backdrop of rampant superstition, Sherlock\'s feisty old flame with a hidden agenda, Irene Adler, has returned to further complicate matters, as the seemingly resurrected Blackwood continues his reign of terror.

When the Queen passes away, the King grieves her death but has to fight against a dark invader army. He rescues a beautiful prisoner, Ravenna, and on the next day he marries her. On the wedding night, Ravenna stabs King Magnus in the chest and brings the enemy army led by her brother Finn that destroys the King\'s army.

Before long, the precious prisoner will escape, and as the deceived huntsman sent to capture Snow White joins forces with the realm\'s rightful Princess, her loyal and courageous army of insurgents prepares for the final confrontation.

For seventeen years, the world\'s survivors are on a train hurtling around the globe creating their own economy and class system. Led by Curtis (Chris Evans), a group of lower-class citizens living in squalor at the back of the train are determined to get to the front of the train and spread the wealth around. Each section of the train holds new surprises for the group who have to battle their way through. A revolution is underway.\r\n-\r\nAnne Campbell\r\n\r\nThe nations release the substance CW-7 with the intention of controlling global warming, but accidentally it results in another Ice Age destroying Earth. The only survivors live in the train Snowpiercer which is driven by a perpetual motion engine created by the millionaire Wilford (Ed Harris) that lives in the engine part. In 2031, after seventeen years, there is a fight of classes inside the train since the oppressed lower class lives in dreadful conditions in the last wagons of the train while the elite lives in the front wagons. The lower class is fed with protein bars only; they are oppressed and punished by Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) and her brutal guards; and their children are taken every now and then when they reach a certain height. The leaders Gilliam (Sir John Hurt), Curtis Everett (Chris Evans), and Edgar (Jamie Bell) are plotting a scheme to reach the engine and talk to Wilford about their conditions using the addicted security engineer Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang-ho) and his clairvoyant daughter Yona (Ko Asung) that are imprisoned to open the locked doors. When the son of Tanya (Octavia Spencer), Tim (Marcanthonee Reis), is captured by Mason, they decide to execute their plan. There are many casualties and soon Curtis discovers that they have been manipulated by Wilford to balance the resources in the train, and why the magnate keeps the lower class alive.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIt\'s 2031, seventeen years after authorities in seventy-nine countries decided collectively to combat global warming with the coolant CW-7. The result was the Earth being immediately sent into a deep freeze, killing all human life except a handful who now live on an \"ark\", a revolutionary train built before 2014 by a train aficionado named Wilford (Ed Harris), the train which at that time was considered useless and self-indulgent. The train is required to be constantly moving to generate energy for life inside, it which circumnavigates the globe on a single continuous track once every year. The train is still controlled in all of its aspects by Wilford, who has created three separate classes housed in different parts of the train: the privileged \"one percent\", who are at the front of the train, the workers who support both ends and occupy the middle of the train, and the \"tail people\", the masses who live at the back of the train like cattle in a windowless cattle car, they being solely fed protein bars, whose ingredients the tail people do not know. The face of Wilford\'s ideology to those in the tail end is Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton), as Wilford never ventures to that end of the train. Some of the policies which Wilford has implemented is taking many of the children from the tail end for an unknown purpose never to be seen by the people in the tail end again, and committing occasional indiscriminate genocide in the tail end, most of the tail people believing as a method of population control, and to demonstrate his dictatorial power in an effort to have a complacent populace amongst the masses. There have been many attempts of revolution by the tail people in the past, all quashed by Wilford. Curtis (Chris Evans), one of the tail people, wants to attempt another revolution, he believing all past attempts having failed because they have focused on Wilford, as opposed to what he feels needs to occur for power: take control of the engine at the front. Supporting Curtis in this fight are, amongst others: Gilliam (Sir John Hurt), the wise old man; Edgar (Jamie Bell), who Curtis took under his wing when he became orphaned in the early years; and Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner), who want to find their children taken away. Along the way, they have to co-opt Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang-ho), an addict of a synthetic hallucinogen called Kronole, he who designed the security system, namely the locking mechanism of the gates between all the train cars.

In the 1800s, a boy becomes a man when he ventures through the breach in pursuit of a fallen star, to prove his love for the village beauty. The star is no lump of rock, it\'s a maiden, Yvaine. Tristan, the youth, is not the only one looking for her: three witches, led by Lamia, want her heart to make them young; and, the sons of the dead king of Stormhold want her because she holds a ruby that will give one of them title to the throne. Assisting Tristan are his mother, the victim of a spell, and a cross-dressing pirate of the skies. Will Tristan win his true love?\r\n-\r\n\r\nIn the 1800s, the clumsy teenager Tristan Thorn crosses the wall in the border of his town to the magic realm of Stormhold to bring a fallen star to his beloved Victoria, a spoiled girl that does not love him, but has promised to marry him if he accomplishes his promise. In the fantasy kingdom, he meets the star Yvaine and imprisons her with a magic rope, promising to release her after meeting Victoria. Yvaine was hit by the magic ruby of the evil King of Stormhold that has promised his throne to the son that could find the stone. Meanwhile, three evil witches led by Lamia seek Yvaine to eat her heart and make them young again, and the two sons of the dead King also search for Yvaine because she wears the necklace with the powerful ruby.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe tiny English village of Wall has a secret. Through a gap in the town\'s old stone wall lies the kingdom of Stormhold, a magical realm of spells, unicorns and witches. One day a boy named Tristan Thorn makes a bet with Victoria, the girl of his dreams, that he can bring her back a falling star that lands beyond the wall. So he journeys through the gap into the wall and into the other world, determined to bring back the fallen star in seven days and win Victoria\'s hand in marriage. To his surprise, the star in question is not a lump of rock, but a plucky celestial Princess named Yvaine, who is not at all pleased to be knocked out of the sky and subsequently kidnapped. And a fallen star, it seems, is quite a commodity in Stormhold. Soon Tristan and Yvaine are running from flying pirates, warring Princes, and three wicked witches who want to cut Yvaine\'s heart out of her chest and eat it in order to restore their eternal youth. To win the bet, Tristan will have to hold his own in a dangerous game of swords and sorcery, but this new world has more surprises in store than he could ever have imagined.\r\n-\r\nasdfghjkl','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:44:11','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::PG\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::7\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::0\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::13+',0),(205,'0120201','Starship Troopers','Starship Troopers','Starship Troopers\r\nInvasión (Starship Troopers)\r\nTropas Estelares\r\nЗвездни рейнджъри\r\nLes patrouilleurs de l\'espace\r\nSvemirski marinci\r\nSvemirski vojnici\r\nHvezdná pechota\r\nHvězdná pěchota\r\nTähesõdalased\r\nStarship troopers - Universumin sotilaat\r\nStratiotes tou sympantos\r\nΣτρατιώτες του Σύμπαντος\r\nCsillagközi invázió\r\nStarship Troopers - Fanteria dello spazio\r\nSutashippu to~urupazu\r\nスターシップ・トゥルーパーズ\r\nErdvėlaivio kariai\r\nInvasión\r\nŻołnierze kosmosu\r\nSoldados do Universo\r\nInfanteria stelara\r\nЗвездный десант\r\nСвемирски војници\r\nVesmírna pechota\r\nVesoljski bojevniki\r\nStarship Troopers (Las brigadas del espacio)\r\n星艦戰將\r\nyıldız Gemisi askerleri\r\nЗоряний десант\r\nستارشب تروبيرز\r\nBug Hunt at Outpost Nine',1997,129,7.2,284715,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Paul Verhoeven','Edward Neumeier\r\nRobert A.

The fight is on to ensure the safety of humanity.\r\n-\r\nChristopher Van Pelt\r\n\r\nThe time is the future. Johnny Rico joins the military after graduation to become a citizen and for the love of his high school sweetheart. In the war against the bug aliens of Klendathu, the military is a very dangerous place to be. Johnny works his way through several battles and with the help of his friends and comrades, helps turn the tide of the war, and save the human race.\r\n-\r\n\r\nSet on the future earth, Johnny rico is a young student dating a girl named Carmen. When Carmen decides to join the military in order to become a class citizen (citizenship is only achieved through serving your country), Johnny follows and joins as well. He soon realizes that he joined for the wrong reasons but just as he is about to quit, an asteroid that originated from the orbit of planet \"klendathu\" hits Buenos Aires (his home town) and kills his family. Johnny and his fellow troopers set out to destroy the planet\'s inhabitants: a type of deadly and very large scaled space bugs. Through a seemingly ordinary action flick, director paul verhoeven creates a subtle anti-war theme, that shows us a fascist and military world far more frightening than WW2\'s Germany, Italy or Russia, the kind of world that is actually functioning.\r\n-\r\nguyshemi\r\n\r\nEarth is united under militaristic organization called \"Federation\". Even in 4school students like Johnny Rico are thought about importance of serving to the Federation. On the surface atmosphere looks pretty relaxed, Johnny is dating beautiful Carmen, he has successful high school football career, loyal friends and rich parents. In the background Federation is in war with highly intelligent insectoid population that has colonized many worlds and are now trying to exterminate humans. Carmen decides to go to a school for a pilot in hope of commanding her own space ship one day and Johnny follows her not wanting to separate, but they eventually get separated in the line of duty when Johnny ends up in the Infantry and Carmen in the Fleet. When tragedy obliterates their home city of Buenos Aires, Johnny gets determined more than ever to put an end to the insectoid aggressor. Driven by hatred of the insectoids, and jealousy for Carmen\'s new boyfriend, Johnny strives to become one of the best soldiers Federation has ever seen... But \"bugs\" prove to be smarter and more resilient than he originally thought...\r\n-\r\nShaddow','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:44:34','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBelgium::KNT/ENA\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::Not Rated\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::12\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R',18),(206,'0796366','Star Trek','Star Trek','Star Trek\r\nStar Trek - El futuro comienza\r\nAlém da Escuridão - Star Trek\r\nСтар Трек\r\n星际迷航\r\nZvjezdane staze\r\nStar Trek - Die Zukunft hat begonnen\r\nΣταρ Τρεκ\r\nSinghung keiyu gei\r\nXingkong qiyu ji\r\nStar Trek (IMAX DMR version)\r\nStar Trek - Il futuro ha inizio\r\nSutâ torekku\r\nスター・トレック\r\nZvaigžņu ceļš\r\nŽvaigždžių kelias\r\nStar Trek: The Future Begins\r\nЗвёздный путь\r\nЗвездане стазе\r\nZvezdne steze\r\nStar Trek: The Beginning\r\n星際爭霸戰\r\nUzay Yolu\r\nЗоряний шлях\r\nStar Trek XI\r\nCorporate Headquarters\r\nStar Trek Zero\r\nStar Trek: The IMAX Experience\r\nCorporate HQ\r\nThe Ernest Castelhun Chronicles\r\nUntitled Walter Lace Project\r\nStar Trek - Viaje a las estrellas\r\nViaje a las estrellas - El futuro comienza\r\nStar Trek: Du Hành Giữa Các Vì Sao',2009,127,7.9,594963,'English','United States\r\nGermany','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','J.J.

Kirk\'s birth, his father dies on his damaged starship in a last stand against a Romulan mining vessel looking for Ambassador Spock, who in this time, has grown on Vulcan disdained by his neighbors for his half-human heritage. 25 years later, James T. Kirk has grown into a young rebellious troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy academy instructors like Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency on Vulcan and the newly-commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy\'s medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of the legend begins.\r\n-\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\nWhen a Romulan mining vessel attacks the USS Kelvin, Lt. George Kirk substitutes his captain, who goes to meet the Romulan captain on his vessel to negotiate a ceasefire. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife who goes into labor giving birth to their son James Kirk, and crashes the Kelvin against the vessel. Aboard the USS Enterprise, the most sophisticated starship ever constructed, a novice crew embarks on its maiden voyage. Their path takes them on a collision course with Nero, the Romulan captain from the future whose mission of vengeance threatens the Federation. Once humanity would survive, rebellious young officer James T.

U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren\'t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it\'s every man for himself?\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nA secret government agency, led by the ruthless, high-ranking official Amanda Waller, recruits some of the most dangerous, incarcerated villains on the planet to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a potentially apocalyptic threat from a mysterious, supernatural entity. If anything goes wrong on this mission, the government will not be liable but rather can place the blame on the villains, who are inherently evil people. A small bomb is implanted in each member of the squad\'s neck with the capability of detonating any time one of the members tries to rebel or escape. It will be up to this assembled team of villains to prevail over the seemingly impossible events that will unfold before them, in what many deem to be a \"suicide mission\".\r\n-\r\nKyle Perez\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Superman, the leader of a secret agency, Amanda Waller, convinces the government to recruit super-villains imprisoned in Belle Reve to protect the world. She summons the hit-man Deadshot; The Joker\'s girlfriend and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn; the pyrokinetic Diablo; the bank thief Captain Boomerang; the mutant Killer Croc; the criminal Slipknot; and the witch Enchantress who possessed the former archaeologist, June Moone, to form Task Force X. Waller also assigns the command of the team to Colonel Rick Flag, who is in love with June. To convince the group to obey orders, a nanite bomb is implanted in the neck of each member. When Enchantress releases her powerful brother, they besiege Midway City turning the residents into an army of monsters and building a powerful weapon. Meanwhile, the Joker is plotting a plan to rescue his beloved Harley Quinn.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nWith Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nFor fear that the next superhero saviour turns terrorist, the calculating, ruthless Intelligence Division agent, Amanda Waller, decides to assemble an elite force of meta-humans: the secret Task Force X. For this reason, Waller hand-picks the worst of the worst from the country\'s maximum-security prisons--a proper circus of psychotic, antisocial super-villains kept on a short leash to do the government\'s dirty work. Of course, if anything goes wrong, the Federals will deny everything. When the Enchantress, an all-powerful shape-shifting sorceress, goes rogue, bent on building a devastating machine, the squad will have to prepare for WWIII. Is the Suicide Squad, the band of expendable anti-heroes, humankind\'s only hope?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:46:46','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nPuerto Rico::PG-13\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(208,'0418279','Transformers','Transformers','Transformers\r\nТрансформърс\r\nTransformers: Le film\r\n变形金刚\r\nTransformeri\r\nAl-motahaveloon\r\nTransformerid\r\nTabdil shavandegan\r\nRobotrickim\r\nToransufômâ\r\nトランスフォーマー\r\nTransformeriai\r\nTransformers - Războiul lor în lumea noastră\r\nТрансформеры\r\nТрансформерси\r\nTransformerji\r\n變形金剛\r\nТрансформери\r\nTransformers: The Movie 2\r\nThe Transformers\r\nPrime Directive\r\nTransformers: The IMAX Experience\r\nTransformerlar\r\nTransformers: Robot Đại Chiến',2007,144,7,621368,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','Michael Bay','Roberto Orci\r\nAlex Kurtzman\r\nJohn Rogers\r\nRoberto Orci\r\nAlex Kurtzman','Kenny Bates\r\nMichael Bay\r\nIan Bryce\r\nAllegra Clegg\r\nMatthew Cohan\r\nTom DeSanto\r\nLorenzo di Bonaventura\r\nBrian Goldner\r\nMichelle McGonagle\r\nDon Murphy\r\nLorne Orleans\r\nSteven Spielberg\r\nGeorge Strayton\r\nMark Vahradian','Steve Jablonsky','Shia LaBeouf\r\nMegan Fox\r\nJosh Duhamel\r\nTyrese Gibson\r\nRachael Taylor\r\nAnthony Anderson\r\nJon Voight\r\nJohn Turturro\r\nMichael O\'Neill\r\nKevin Dunn\r\nJulie White\r\nAmaury Nolasco\r\nZack Ward\r\nLuis Echagarruga\r\nPatrick Mulderrig\r\nBrian Shehan\r\nMichael Trisler\r\nAshkan Kashanchi\r\nRizwan Manji\r\nWilliam Morgan Sheppard\r\nC.J.

Warriors from Asgard stopped them, but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escaped to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether, and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth, but his father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some Policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor\'s mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki\'s motivations remain unknown.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nThere are nine realms of Asgard, and once every five thousand years, they align. Earth happens to be one of these realms. These realms create portals between the worlds during the alignment which is called \"Convergence\". On Earth, in London, England, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) believes she and her crew have discovered one such portal. Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called the Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor (Chris Hemsworth) from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately, in doing so, it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard. Devising a plan with his brother, the war criminal Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor heads to \"The Dark World\" to destroy the Aether and save Asgard. But can Loki be trusted?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nA year after Loki\'s (Tom Hiddleston\'s) devastating alien attack on New York City, the Mighty Thor (Chris Hemsworth), along with his friends Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three fight to save the Nine Realms from deadly threats. When Thor\'s girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) discovers a fluid like weapon called the Aether, she unknowingly awakens the evil Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his Dark Elf army. With this, Asgard may be facing its darkest hour.

As a result, humankind is now pushed to the brink of a brutal, worldwide civil war. Now, against the backdrop of the imminent confrontation between the government and the \"others\", Ultraviolet, an infected beautiful Haemophage, finds herself caught in the middle, protecting Six, a helpless nine-year-old boy who has been marked for death by the military forces of Daxus. Can Ultraviolet destroy Daxus\' ultimate anti-Haemophage weapon?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nHuman society has been decimated by a holocaust caused by biological warfare research gone wrong: instead of creating super-soldiers, a genetically-engineered virus turns infected humans into Hemophages, a vampire-like sub-species with enhanced physical abilities. In the infection-paranoid and technologically advanced society that follows, Violet is a singular Hemophage warrior battling the totalitarian dictator who is determined to wipe out her species at any cost.\r\n-\r\nMurray Chapman\r\n\r\nViolet lives in a totalitarian world in the future, ruled by Daxus. Once she was a human and the assistant of his husband, a scientist, murdered by the police forces of Daxus, who has turned into vampires a considerable part of the human race just to enlarge his forces. Violet has the task of rescue a secret weapon: a boy named Six. After knowing the real intentions of this people with the boy, Violet takes him away and she\'ll be chased by Daxus, because Six carries in his blood a rare cure, which could heal Violet and all the vampires.\r\n-\r\nAlejandro Frias\r\n\r\nIn the late 21st a disease called Hemophagia has genetically modified nearly an entire race of people, leaving them with such enhanced speed, intelligence, and strength that they resemble vampires in nearly every way. Fear begins to breed within the power elite as the disease continues to spread and those infected prove to be truly superhuman, and now, a civil war is brewing between uninfected humans and those altered by Hemophagia. Caught dead in the center of it is an infected woman called Violet, who is bent on vengeance and has little left to lose. Provoked beyond reason by powers that will not rest until she and her people are dead, she will become everything her persecutors feared her to be\r\n-\r\nCammila Albertson','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:53:51','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13',12),(214,'1049413','Up','Up','Up\r\nUp - Una aventura de altura\r\nUp: Altas Aventuras\r\nВ небето\r\nLà-haut\r\nUp: Una Aventura de Altura\r\n飞屋环游记\r\nNebesa\r\nVzhůru do oblak\r\nOp\r\nÜles\r\nUp - kohti korkeuksia\r\nOben\r\nPsila ston ourano\r\nΨηλά στον ουρανό\r\n沖天救兵\r\nFel!\r\nBaala\r\nKâru jîsan no sora-tobu ie\r\nGrandpa Carl\'s Flying House\r\nカールじいさんの空飛ぶ家\r\nAugšup\r\nAukštyn\r\nUp, una aventura de altura\r\nSe opp\r\nOdlot\r\nUp - Altamente\r\nDeasupra tuturor\r\nВверх\r\nДо неба\r\nHore\r\nV višave\r\nUpp\r\n天外奇蹟\r\nPu Sa Ba Phalang\r\nYukarı Bak\r\nВперед і вгору\r\nTepaga\r\nVút Bay',2009,96,8.2,998639,'English','United States','Animation\r\nAdventure\r\nComedy\r\nDrama\r\nFamily','Pete Docter\r\nBob Peterson','Pete Docter\r\nBob Peterson\r\nTom McCarthy\r\nBob Peterson\r\nPete Docter','John Lasseter\r\nKori Rae\r\nDenise Ream\r\nJonas Rivera\r\nAndrew Stanton','Michael Giacchino','Ed Asner\r\nChristopher Plummer\r\nJordan Nagai\r\nBob Peterson\r\nDelroy Lindo\r\nJerome Ranft\r\nJohn Ratzenberger\r\nDavid Kaye\r\nElie Docter\r\nJeremy Leary\r\nMickie McGowan\r\nDanny Mann\r\nDonald Fullilove\r\nJess Harnell\r\nJosh Cooley\r\nPete Docter\r\nMark Andrews\r\nBob Bergen\r\nBrenda Chapman\r\nEmma Coats\r\nJohn Cygan\r\nPaul Eiding\r\nTony Fucile\r\nTeresa Ganzel\r\nSherry Lynn\r\nLaraine Newman\r\nTeddy Newton\r\nJeff Pidgeon\r\nValerie LaPointe\r\nJan Rabson\r\nBob Scott\r\nRob Paulsen\r\nHarry Shearer','Fly Up to Venezuela\r\n\r\nThe greatest adventure is just getting back home.','78-year-old Carl Fredricksen travels to Paradise Falls in his house equipped with balloons, inadvertently taking a young stowaway.','78-year-old Carl Fredricksen travels to Paradise Falls in his house equipped with balloons, inadvertently taking a young stowaway.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, Carl Fredricksen wanted to explore South America and find the forbidden Paradise Falls.

It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, who struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than monsters and beasts. But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a special gift, the three must learn to navigate independently the increasingly volatile Continent.\r\n-\r\naaltaiawy\r\n\r\nGeralt of Rivia, a brooding professional monster hunter for hire also known as witcher, struggles to keep his humanity in a medieval dark fantasy world ruled by corrupt kings, queens and mages, where poverty, violence and intolerance are rampant, normal humans are sometimes worse than actual monsters and most jobs that pay well involve the darkest of human emotions and desires. Yennefer of Vengerberg is an ambitious mage who came from nothing and wants everything. Princess Cirilla or Ciri is a young girl who may or may not possess some great mysterious power within her. Their destinies, seemingly quite different, slowly intertwine in a rather cosmic fashion. Their companions include Jaskier the bard, Geralt\'s endearingly annoying friend and hype man vowed to spread the word of his heroics throughout the continent even if he has to embellish them a little for a few coins more, Tissaia de Vries, Yennefer\'s secretive mentor who believes in tough love, and Triss Merigold, a good-natured druidic mage and trustworthy friend. The Nilfgaardian Empire\'s sudden brutal invasion of the kingdom of Cintra ruled by Cirilla\'s protective grandmother, warrior queen Calanthe, puts their lives in great danger.\r\n\r\nGeralt of Rivia is a witcher, a mutant with special powers who kills monsters for money. The land is in a state of turmoil, due to the empire of Nilfgaard seeking to enlarge its territory. Among the refugees of this struggle is Cirilla, the Princess of Cintra, one of Nilfgaard\'s victims. She and Geralt share a destiny. Meanwhile, another figure looms large in Geralt\'s adventures: Yennefer, a sorceress.\r\n-\r\ngrantss','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-14 11:57:41','','','','','',1,2,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::TV-MA\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHungary::18\r\nIndia::18\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::16\r\nPhilippines::18+\r\nPoland::16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::16+\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::TV-MA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C18',16),(218,'6468322','Money Heist','Money Heist','La casa de papel\r\nMoney Heist\r\nLa Casa de Papel\r\nКъща от хартия\r\nLa maison de papier\r\nLa Casa De Papel\r\nPapírový dům\r\nPapirhuset\r\nEl profesor\r\nRahapaja\r\nHaus des Geldes\r\nΗ Τέλεια Ληστεία\r\nA nagy pénzrablás\r\nMoney heist\r\nLa casa di carta\r\nペーパー・ハウス\r\nPinigų namai\r\nFabrica de bani\r\nDom z papieru\r\nБумажный дом\r\nКућа од папира\r\nDom z papiera\r\nLa Casa de Papel: Parte 3\r\n紙房子\r\nBüyük Soygun\r\nПаперовий будинок\r\nQog\'oz uy\r\nPhi Vụ Triệu Đô',2017,70,8.2,443920,'Spanish\r\nRussian\r\nSerbian\r\nEnglish','Spain','Action\r\nCrime\r\nDrama\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Jesús Colmenar\r\nAlex Rodrigo\r\nKoldo Serra\r\nAlejandro Bazzano\r\nJavier Quintas\r\nMiguel Ángel Vivas\r\nAlbert Pintó','Álex Pina\r\nÁlex Pina\r\nÁlex Pina\r\nÁlex Pina\r\nÁlex Pina\r\nJavier Gómez Santander\r\nJavier Gómez Santander\r\nJavier Gómez Santander\r\nJuan Salvador López\r\nEsther Martínez Lobato\r\nEsther Martínez Lobato\r\nDavid Barrocal\r\nDavid Barrocal\r\nDavid Barrocal\r\nLuis Moya\r\nPablo Roa\r\nFernando Sancristóbal\r\nAna Boyero\r\nEsther Morales\r\nEsther Morales\r\nEmilio Díez\r\nAlmudena Ramirez Pantanella\r\nAlberto Úcar','Álex Pina\r\nJesús Colmenar\r\nEsther Martínez Lobato\r\nPedro García Caja\r\nNacho Manubens\r\nSonia Martínez\r\nCristina López Ferraz\r\nLaia Coll\r\nMigue Amoedo\r\nJavier Gómez Santander','Iván Martínez Lacámara\r\nManel Santisteban','Úrsula Corberó\r\nÁlvaro Morte\r\nItziar Ituño\r\nPedro Alonso\r\nMiguel Herrán\r\nJaime Lorente\r\nEsther Acebo\r\nDarko Peric\r\nEnrique Arce\r\nAlba Flores\r\nFernando Soto\r\nMario de la Rosa\r\nHovik Keuchkerian\r\nRodrigo de la Serna\r\nNajwa Nimri\r\nLuka Peros\r\nFernando Cayo\r\nRocco Narva\r\nPaco Tous\r\nAhikar Azcona\r\nAntonio Romero\r\nBelén Cuesta\r\nJuan Fernández\r\nOlalla Hernández\r\nCarlos Suárez\r\nKiti Mánver\r\nPep Munné\r\nMari Carmen Sánchez\r\nRoberto Garcia\r\nMaría Pedraza\r\nMikel Bustamante\r\nJosé Manuel Poga\r\nAntonio Cuellar Rodriguez\r\nAnna Gras\r\nClara Alvarado\r\nRamón Agirre\r\nCristina Saavedra\r\nDiana Gómez\r\nMiquel García Borda\r\nAlberto Lobo\r\nFran Morcillo\r\nJosé Manuel Seda\r\nJennifer Miranda\r\nFrancisco Javier Pastor\r\nRené León\r\nAlberto Amarilla\r\nAjay Jethi\r\nNaia Guz\r\nMustafa Haidari\r\nRoman Rymar\r\nXavi Ortuzar\r\nPatrick Criado\r\nJuan Carlos Heredia\r\nAgnès Llobet\r\nSara Solomando\r\nIrene Anula\r\nPep Tosar\r\nPedro Pablo Isla\r\nAntonio García Ferreras\r\nMarina Esteve\r\nCristina Gómez Alvis\r\nIrene Molina\r\nPaolo Sanminiatelli\r\nNeymar\r\nRafael Rojas\r\nLuca Anton\r\nErika Bleda\r\nJavier Perdiguero\r\nPeter Nikolas\r\nÓscar Zafra\r\nOti Manzano\r\nPráxedes Nieto\r\nMery Cabezuelo\r\nBárbara de Lema\r\nElisabet Gelabert\r\nMiguel Ángel Silvestre\r\nFlorencia Nocetti\r\nRubén Valero\r\nJesús Lloveras\r\nDeborah Guerrero\r\nJavier Bolea\r\nChacha Huang\r\nDariam Coco\r\nChema Ruiz\r\nDaniel Toscano\r\nXavi Sáez\r\nMaya Murofushi\r\nMarjorie E.

Captain America, the Stark Enterprises created super soldier. Thor, the god of thunder, protector of Earth and his home planet of Asgard, and Loki\'s brother.

Tony Stark discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron decides that is necessary to annihilate mankind in order to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins.

Will they succeed?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAfter a successful raid on a HYDRA base, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an Artificial Intelligence called Ultron, a peacekeeping protocol designed to help the Avengers protect the world from their enemies. But things go wrong when Ultron sees the human race as a threat and sets out to destroy it along with the Avengers. Now the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, must reassemble to stop Ultron from causing mass destruction. Aside from this, the Avengers also must take on the powerful twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as well as the new entity called Vision. Also, the Avengers find that things may never be the same again after discovering a power beyond their comprehension.\r\n\r\nSince the events of the last film, the Avengers have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren\'t able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive too seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he\'ll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of super-powered siblings Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the homicidal android.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-15 13:40:30','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::7\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::P',12),(222,'4154756','Avengers: Infinity War','Avengers: Infinity War','Avengers: Infinity War\r\nAvengers 3: Infinity War\r\nVingadores: Guerra Infinita\r\nОтмъстителите: Война без край\r\nAvengers: la guerre de l\'infini\r\n复仇者联盟3：无限战争\r\nOsvetnici: Rat beskonačnosti\r\nTasujad: Igaviku sõda\r\nΕκδικητές: Ο πόλεμος της αιωνιότητας\r\nBosszúállók: Végtelen háború\r\nHa\'nokmim: Milkhemet ha\'einsof\r\nアベンジャーズ　インフィニティ・ウォー\r\nAtriebēji: Bezgalības karš\r\nKeršytojai: Begalybės karas\r\nAvengers: Wojna bez granic\r\nVingadores: Guerra do Infinito\r\nRăzbunătorii: Războiul infinitului\r\nМстители: Война бесконечности\r\nОсветници: Рат бескраја\r\nAvengers: Nekonečná vojna\r\nMaščevalci: Brezmejna vojna\r\nVengadores: La guerra del infinito - 1ª parte\r\nVengadores: Infinity War\r\n復仇者聯盟：無限之戰\r\nAvengers: Sonsuzluk Savaşı\r\nМесники: Війна нескінченності\r\nThe Avengers 3\r\nMary Lou\r\nQasoskorlar: Cheksizlik urushi\r\nQasoskorlar: Abadiyat jangi\r\nAvengers: Cuộc Chiến Vô Cực\r\nAvengers: Infinity War - Part I',2018,149,8.4,977871,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','Anthony Russo\r\nJoe Russo','Christopher Markus\r\nStephen McFeely\r\nStan Lee\r\nJack Kirby\r\nJoe Simon\r\nJack Kirby\r\nSteve Englehart\r\nSteve Gan\r\nBill Mantlo\r\nKeith Giffen\r\nJim Starlin\r\nStan Lee\r\nLarry Lieber\r\nJack Kirby\r\nSteve Englehart\r\nDon Heck\r\nJim Starlin','Victoria Alonso\r\nMitchell Bell\r\nAri Costa\r\nLouis D\'Esposito\r\nJon Favreau\r\nKevin Feige\r\nMichael Grillo\r\nJames Gunn\r\nStan Lee\r\nJoAnn Perritano\r\nEdu Sallouti\r\nNicholas Simon\r\nTrinh Tran\r\nJen Underdahl','Alan Silvestri','Robert Downey Jr.\r\nChris Hemsworth\r\nMark Ruffalo\r\nChris Evans\r\nScarlett Johansson\r\nDon Cheadle\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch\r\nTom Holland\r\nChadwick Boseman\r\nZoe Saldana\r\nKaren Gillan\r\nTom Hiddleston\r\nPaul Bettany\r\nElizabeth Olsen\r\nAnthony Mackie\r\nSebastian Stan\r\nIdris Elba\r\nDanai Gurira\r\nPeter Dinklage\r\nBenedict Wong\r\nPom Klementieff\r\nDave Bautista\r\nVin Diesel\r\nBradley Cooper\r\nGwyneth Paltrow\r\nBenicio Del Toro\r\nJosh Brolin\r\nChris Pratt\r\nSean Gunn\r\nWilliam Hurt\r\nLetitia Wright\r\nTerry Notary\r\nTom Vaughan-Lawlor\r\nCarrie Coon\r\nMichael James Shaw\r\nStan Lee\r\nWinston Duke\r\nFlorence Kasumba\r\nKerry Condon\r\nMonique Ganderton\r\nJacob Batalon\r\nTiffany Espensen\r\nIsabella Amara\r\nEthan Dizon\r\nAriana Greenblatt\r\nAmeenah Kaplan\r\nRoss Marquand\r\nMichael Anthony Rogers\r\nStephen McFeely\r\nAaron Lazar\r\nRobert Pralgo\r\nOlaniyan Thurmon\r\nBlair Jasin\r\nMatthew Zuk\r\nLaura Miller\r\nMarija Juliette Abney\r\nJaneshia Adams-Ginyard\r\nGee Alexander\r\nBranden Arnold\r\nKenneth Branagh\r\nSergio Briones\r\nDonny Carrington\r\nLucie Carroll\r\nJamel Chambers\r\nMatthew Christensen\r\nTye Claybrook Jr.\r\nKeith Splinter Davis\r\nCory Dunson\r\nTony Dupar\r\nJazzy Ellis\r\nDavid Dman Escobar\r\nSteven Essani\r\nJacob Evans\r\nMatthew Excel\r\nSimeon Freeman\r\nDylan Gajai\r\nDaniela Gaskie\r\nJohn Gettier\r\nJomahl Gildersleve\r\nDenisha Gillespie\r\nSolomon Glave\r\nDaniel Graham\r\nCarlos Guity\r\nDawit Gulilat\r\nMartavius Gunn\r\nCecil M.

But when the world of Grey, a self-labeled technophobe, is turned upside down, his only hope for revenge is an experimental computer chip implant.\r\n\r\nGrey\'s a stay-at-home mechanic, whose wife is Asha. One day, Grey asks Asha to help him return a car to his client. Whilst Grey and Asha\'s self-driving car malfunctions, it crashes. Grey watches helplessly as Asha bleeds to death next to him. Grey returns home - a widowed quadriplegic, under the care of his mother. His wife\'s death and the inability of police to identify their attackers cause him to sink into a depression. After a suicide attempt, he\'s offered to have high tech chip implanted - enabling him to walk. Though initially hesitant, he\'s persuaded to have the surgery.\r\n\r\nIn a not-so-distant future, where the machines have seamlessly integrated into the multifaceted aspects of our lives, the world relies almost entirely on technology to do even the most complicated tasks for us. As a result, more and more, the old-school, tech-shy car mechanic, Grey Trace, is feeling like a fish out of water; a stubbornly analogue man living in a brave new digital world.

Hastar is a terrible entity who can curse a person yet also can grant gold coins. And the story put emphasis on human nature and the never ending greed. The myth of Hastar is, when the Goddess of Prosperity created the world she gave birth to Hastar followed by 16 Crore Gods and Goddesses. Hastar being her first born was her favorite child, but Hastar was very greedy. When the Goddess of Prosperity offered Hastar the ownership of all the gold in the universe or all the food, he took the gold as well as tried to take over the food in his greed fighting with his brothers and sisters. The 16 crore gods and goddesses overpowered Hastar and when they tried to kill him, the Goddess of Prosperity intervened and begged for his life. The 16 crore gods and goddesses accepted her request on one condition, that Hastar will never be mentioned in the Puranas nor he should be ever worshiped.\r\n\r\nGoddess of prosperity a symbol of wealth and food had given birth to around 160 Crore children when universe was created her most closest child was first born Hatsar who was hungry for gold and food.He managed to acquire gold from his mother but was attacked by others when he tried to gain food and was saved by his mother he was forgiven on a condition that he wont ever be worshiped like others and would be forgotten in history.In 1918 Vinayak\'s mother serves Sarkar sexual favors at his Wada for gold coin while at home she has two sons Vinayak and Sadashiv and taking care of a demon Sarkar\'s great grandmother who knows about hidden treasure in Wada.After Sarkar passes away Vinayak\'s mother decides to leave the village with him and Sadashiv but Vinayak is hungry for the hidden treasure and wants to know from the demon Sadashiv passes away due to accident and both leave the village with Vinayak promising his mother never to return Tumbbad.Fourteen years later a grown up Vinayak is in debts and returns to Tumbbad to find the treasure he sees the demon is still alive and a tree has come up on her body she tells him about the hidden treasure which leads in womb of the goddess where Hastar sleeps.The Demon tells Vinayak that he will have to give her salvation after he leads the path and also warns that he will be cursed like her if he touches the treasure.For years Vinayak starts taking gold from Wada and at a certain age he is not that fit an active and starts to train his son Pandurang for the same.\r\n-\r\nalex.mjacko@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThe story is based on the Indian mythology of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food. One family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated mansion due to which the family gets ostracized but only an old man stays alone with the idol of the demon. The mistress of the old man do visit the mansion everyday. The house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the mistress and her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old man who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon and the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism.\r\n-\r\nFella_shibby@yahoo.com','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-04-25','','2020-04-24 14:17:17','','','','','',0,0,1,'India::A\r\nMexico::B15\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::Not Rated\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(227,'3748528','Rogue One: A Star Wars Story','Rogue One: A Star Wars Story','Rogue One\r\nRogue One: Një Rrëfenjë nga Lufta e Yjeve\r\nRogue One: Una historia de Star Wars\r\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\r\nRogue One: Uma História Star Wars\r\nRogue One: История от Междузвездни войни\r\nRogue One - Une histoire de Star Wars\r\n星球大战外传：侠盗一号\r\nRogue One: Priča iz Ratova Zvijezda\r\nRogue One: Star Wars Story\r\nRogue One: Tähesõdade lugu\r\nRogue One: A Star Wars story\r\nStar Wars: Rogue One\r\nZsivány Egyes: Egy Star Wars-történet\r\nRogue akhat: Sipour Milkhemet ha\'Kokhavim\r\nローグ・ワン　スター・ウォーズ・ストーリー\r\nКүрескер - бір: Жұлдызды соғыстар.

This is the story of that event, the aftermath, how the real reasons for the incident were covered up and how one man fought to reveal them.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nOn April 26, 1986 the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near Pripyat, Ukraine experienced a malfunction which resulted in a core explosion in reactor 4. This miniseries follows Valery Legasov, the lead scientist working to control the disaster, Boris Shcherbina, a Soviet politician representing the interests of the Soviet government during the disaster, and Ulana Khomyuk, a nuclear physicist working to uncover the truth about what really happened at Chernobyl. This series tackles the problems that arise when the truth is ignored and kept from the public, begging the question: \"What is the cost of lies?\".\r\n\r\nIn 1986, Chernobyl suffered the worst nuclear meltdown in human history: changing the course of the Soviet Union and leading to the inevitable downfall of Communism in Europe. This is the story of what happened on the frontlines of the chaos, the cover-ups behind closed doors, and the civilians held prisoner to the circumstances of Earth\'s greatest nuclear disaster.\r\n-\r\nJohnny','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-19 04:24:42','','','','','',1,1,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14+\r\nChile::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::12\r\nHungary::18\r\nItaly::VM12\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::TV-MA',16),(229,'0434409','V for Vendetta','V for Vendetta','V for Vendetta\r\nV de venganza\r\nVendetta üçün V\r\nV kao vendeta\r\nV de Vingança\r\nV като Вендета\r\nV pour vendetta\r\nV字仇杀队\r\nO za osvetu\r\nV jako Vendeta\r\nV nagu veritasu\r\nV för vendetta\r\nV niin kuin verikosto\r\nV wie Vendetta\r\nV mint vérbosszú\r\nVendetta\r\nV per Vendetta\r\nV fô vendetta\r\nVフォー・ヴェンデッタ\r\nV ir Vendeta\r\nV - tai Vendeta\r\nV de Venganza\r\nV jak vendetta\r\nW jak wendeta\r\nV de la Vendetta\r\n«V» значит Вендетта\r\nВ као вендета\r\nV ako Vendeta\r\nV kot vroče maščevanje\r\nV de Vendetta\r\nV för Vendetta\r\nV怪客\r\nPhetchakhat Nakak Phaya Yom\r\nV - V for Vendetta\r\n«V» означає Вендетта\r\nV for Vendetta: At the IMAX\r\nV for Vendetta: The IMAX Experience\r\nV: Vendetta demakdir\r\nChiến Binh Tự Do',2005,132,8.1,1086885,'English','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nGermany','Action\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','James McTeigue','Lilly Wachowski\r\nLana Wachowski\r\nDavid Lloyd','Jessica Alan\r\nGrant Hill\r\nRoberto Malerba\r\nHenning Molfenter\r\nLorne Orleans\r\nJoel Silver\r\nLana Wachowski\r\nLilly Wachowski\r\nBen Waisbren\r\nCharlie Woebcken','Dario Marianelli','Natalie Portman\r\nHugo Weaving\r\nStephen Rea\r\nStephen Fry\r\nJohn Hurt\r\nTim Pigott-Smith\r\nRupert Graves\r\nRoger Allam\r\nBen Miles\r\nSinéad Cusack\r\nNatasha Wightman\r\nJohn Standing\r\nEddie Marsan\r\nClive Ashborn\r\nEmma Field-Rayner\r\nIan Burfield\r\nMark Phoenix\r\nAlister Mazzotti\r\nBillie Cook\r\nGuy Henry\r\nCosima Shaw\r\nMegan Gay\r\nRoderic Culver\r\nTara Hacking\r\nAndy Rashleigh\r\nChad Stahelski\r\nAntje Rau\r\nAmelda Brown\r\nRichard Campbell\r\nPatricia Gannon\r\nMark Longhurst\r\nSimon Holmes\r\nCharles Cork\r\nJohn Ringham\r\nOliver Bradshaw\r\nJack Schouten\r\nCaoimhe Murdock\r\nJuliet Howland\r\nBrin Rosser\r\nRaife Patrick Burchell\r\nJoseph Rye\r\nAdrian Finighan\r\nMalcolm Sinclair\r\nBradley Steve Ford\r\nMadeleine Rakic-Platt\r\nSelina Giles\r\nCarsten Hayes\r\nDerek Hutchinson\r\nMartin Savage\r\nGrant Burgin\r\nGreg Donaldson\r\nImogen Poots\r\nJason Griffiths\r\nLaura Greenwood\r\nKyra Meyer\r\nPaul Antony-Barber\r\nAnna Farnworth\r\nMary Stockley\r\nSimon Newby\r\nDavid Merheb\r\nDaniel Donaldson\r\nDulcie Smart\r\nBen Posener\r\nIan T.

She is an employee of the state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the letter \"V\". V informs Evey that she must hide in his underground lair for at least one year, and while she is reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between the two individuals.

Incomparably charismatic skilled in the art of combat. V detonates two London landmarks and takes over the government, urging his fellow citizens to rise up.

However, in the midst of all this chaos, one man known only by the name V (Hugo Weaving) dares to stand up to the government and is labeled as a terrorist. One night V rescues a mild young woman called Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), and an unlikely bond between the two emerges which results with Evey becoming Vs ally. But though V may be charismatic and have a passion for justice he also is bitter and has his own personal hatred of the government for something they did to him long ago. As November the 5th, the day V says he and those who will follow him will stand up to the government once and for all approaches, Detective Finch (Stephen Rea) becomes more and more determined to uncover the truth about V, however his search leads him to ask to question whether or not he is on the right side.\r\n-\r\nx_babyangel\r\n\r\nIn this obscure and Gothic tale, one attractive girl, Evey (Natalie Portman), gets involved accidentally in a terrorist attack, perpetrated by a masked and megalomaniac character, V (Hugo Weaving).

However, in present time, the Orwellian London lives under the fascist government of Chancellor Adam (Sir John Hurt), and V will fight against his regime, using the power of powder, blowing up important buildings. Evey will be chased by the Secret Police, thinking that she\'s the accomplice of V, who will accomplish Fawkes\' mission of destroying the Parlament on the 5th of November, in this mixture of The Phantom of the Opera, George Orwell\'s 1984, and Batman.\r\n-\r\nAlejandro Frias','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-19 13:09:12','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-17\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::15A\r\nIsrael::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(230,'0462465','Outlander','Outlander','Outlander\r\nOutlander: Guerreiro vs Predador\r\nЧуждоземецът\r\nVikingové II\r\nOutlander: Le Dernier Viking\r\nA kívülálló\r\nOutlander - L\'ultimo vichingo\r\nアウトランダー\r\nAtnācējs\r\nSvetimsalis\r\nLa Tierra Media\r\nOutlander - A Vingança\r\nВикинги\r\nВикинги против пришельцев\r\nСтранац\r\nVikingovia 2\r\n魔獸戰場\r\nYabancı\r\nВікінги',2008,115,6.2,74856,'English\r\nNorse, Old\r\nLatin','United States\r\nGermany\r\nFrance','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','Howard McCain','Dirk Blackman\r\nHoward McCain','Neishaw Ali\r\nDirk Blackman\r\nDon Carmody\r\nColin Davies\r\nPhilip Elway\r\nAndreas Grosch\r\nNicole Haeussermann\r\nJodi Heaston\r\nKia Jam\r\nKaren Loop\r\nIain McCaig\r\nOmar McClinton\r\nBarrie M.

When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death, and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet in London in the 1800s, two rival magicians read each others diary containing the secrets of their magic tricks and personal life. As we go back in time when the diaries were written, both magicians become obsessed with their rival\'s best trick. The tricks, as shown to the audience, look the same, but neither magician can figure out how his opponent does it.\r\n-\r\ngary\r\n\r\nTwo magicians, who used to be partners, battle over years in order to create a flawless method for the ultimate disappearing trick, \"the Transported Man\", turns into an informal war between them, and soon, they will do anything to be able to preform the trick sooner and better than the other; which as time passes makes their friends and loved ones get away from them, and little-by-little destroys their lives until they eventually succeed to preform the trick, each by a very different way.\r\n-\r\nJ. S. Golden\r\n\r\nIn nineteenth century London, illusionist Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow illusionist, Robert Angier. Borden\'s indictment is largely possible because of the eyewitness account of John Cutter, who saw Borden backstage in the area where Angier was killed. At the end of one of his shows, Angier fell through a trap door in the stage floor into a clear water-filled tank below, that tank which was a prop for one of Angier\'s tricks performed earlier in the show. Angier ended up drowning, as the tank was locked after he fell into it. Borden, Angier, and Cutter have a shared largely turbulent history, which also provides motive. Early in their magic careers, both Borden and Angier worked under \"Milton the Magician\", while Angier\'s wife Julia worked as his on-stage assistant, and Cutter as his ingénieur, staging the tricks and providing the apparatus required, work that he still does for others. Based on a specific incident during this stage of their relationship led to both Borden and Angier striking out, creating their own shows, and them having a feud, which was not only in the professional realm, but a personal one, where each man wanted to ruin the other. While Borden is arguably more accomplished in the technical aspects of the illusions, Angier is the more accomplished showman. In the professional realm, they tried to outdo each other, especially in the illusions considered either the most dangerous and/or mysterious, those two being catching-the-bullet trick, and more so, the transported man trick. In the process of their feud, they seemingly were not averse to any means, even with collateral damage of others. The question is if those means extend to murder, especially of the other.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIllusionists Angier & Borden were once stage partners, but when a trick goes tragically wrong the pair form an intense rivalry which endangers the lives of their loved ones. The Prestige is an intricate tale of obsession, jealousy and deception.\r\n-\r\nBecksyKane\r\n\r\nA mysterious story of two magicians, whose intense rivalry leads them on a life-long battle for supremacy, full of obsession, deceit, and jealousy, with dangerous and deadly consequences. From the time that they first met as young magicians on the rise, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden were competitors. However, their friendly competition evolves into a bitter rivalry making them fierce enemies-for-life, and consequently jeopardizing the lives of everyone around them. Set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century London.\r\n-\r\nRopeOfSilicone.com','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-19 15:13:29','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRomania::I.C.-14\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',0),(233,'2397535','Predestination','Predestination','Predestination\r\nPreodredište\r\nO Predestinado\r\nPrédestination\r\nPredestinación\r\n前目的地\r\nPredestination: Paradox času\r\nEttemääratus\r\nBedistsera\r\nΤαξιδιώτης στον χρόνο\r\nIdőhurok\r\nプリデスティネーション\r\nLemtis\r\nPrzeznaczenie\r\nPredestinado\r\nПатруль времени\r\nПредодређење\r\n超時空攔截\r\nZamanın Ötesinde\r\nПризначення\r\nTiền Định',2014,97,7.5,272552,'English','Australia\r\nUnited States','Action\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Michael Spierig\r\nPeter Spierig','Michael Spierig\r\nPeter Spierig\r\nRobert A.

As he tries to figure out why he survived and tries to deal with people in his town, like the school bully, his conservative health teacher, and a self-help guru, Frank continues to turn up in Donnie\'s mind, causing him to commit acts of vandalism and worse.\r\n-\r\nMTRodaba2468','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-19 15:20:53','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nCzechia::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',12),(237,'2798920','Annihilation','Annihilation','Annihilation\r\nAniquilación\r\nAniquilação\r\nИзтребление\r\nVyhlazení\r\nHäving\r\nHävitys\r\nAuslöschung\r\nΑφανισμός\r\nExpedíció\r\nAnnientamento\r\nアナイアレイション　全滅領域\r\nSunaikinimas\r\nAnihilacja\r\nAnihilare\r\nАннигиляция\r\nУништење\r\nVyhladenie\r\n滅絕\r\nYok Oluş\r\nАнігіляція\r\nVùng Hủy Diệt',2018,115,6.8,306618,'English','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom','Adventure\r\nDrama\r\nHorror\r\nMystery\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Alex Garland','Alex Garland\r\nJeff VanderMeer','Jo Burn\r\nEli Bush\r\nAllegra Clegg\r\nDavid Ellison\r\nDana Goldberg\r\nDon Granger\r\nAndrew Macdonald\r\nAllon Reich\r\nScott Rudin\r\nJoanne Smith','Geoff Barrow\r\nBen Salisbury','Natalie Portman\r\nBenedict Wong\r\nSonoya Mizuno\r\nDavid Gyasi\r\nOscar Isaac\r\nJohn Schwab\r\nJennifer Jason Leigh\r\nGina Rodriguez\r\nTuva Novotny\r\nTessa Thompson\r\nSammy Hayman\r\nJosh Danford\r\nKristen McGarrity\r\nKola Bokinni\r\nAnnarie Boor\r\nKirk Bowett\r\nLuis Cherubini\r\nRichard Clark\r\nBern Collaço\r\nHoney Holmes\r\nCosmo Jarvis\r\nBobby Mahmi\r\nObie Matthew\r\nOdette Michell\r\nKumud Pant\r\nHiten Patel\r\nDaniel Prewitt\r\nMatthew Simpson\r\nLily Taylor\r\nMiroslav Zaruba','Fear What\'s Inside\r\n\r\nOne way in.

In flashback, Kane, an Army Special Forces soldier, appears in their home after having disappeared on a mission nearly a year ago. He remembers nothing of that time and suddenly falls very ill.

She has to meet her lover Sam in lunch breaks, and they cannot get married because Sam has to give most of his money away in alimony. One Friday, Marion is trusted to bank forty thousand dollars by her employer. Seeing the opportunity to take the money and start a new life, Marion leaves town and heads towards Sam\'s California store.

Marion senses an opportunity when one of Lowery\'s wealthy clients pays his account with forty thousand dollars cash, Marion is tasked with taking the money to the bank. Being a Friday afternoon, Marion believes she can slip out of town immediately undetected with the money to join Sam in Fairvale, California where he lives, before Lowery would even suspect that she has absconded with the money the earliest by Monday. Despite several close calls, Marion is able to make it to fifteen miles short of Fairvale at the Bates Motel, where she stops on the rainy Saturday night. The isolated motel has had little business ever since the state highway was moved. The motel is run by friendly, but lonely Norman Bates, who lives with with his invalid mother in the big, old house on the hill overlooking the motel. Although she doesn\'t meet Mrs. Bates, Marion knows that she is an angry, controlling woman based on an argument she overhears between her and Norman. Norman admits that his mother is mentally mad. That evening, Marion has a change of heart and contemplates returning to Phoenix to return the money. But she never makes it either to Phoenix or Fairvale. As such, several people come looking for her, including Sam, who is suspected of being in cahoots with Marion in stealing the money, Marion\'s worried sister Lila Crane, who is able to convince Lowery not to press charges if Marion returns the money, and a private investigator named Arbogast who was hired by Lowery. At various times, they all make their way to the mysterious Bates Motel, where Mrs. Bates will do whatever required to maintain control of what happens at the motel and within her family.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nFor Marion Crane, it\'s been quite an eventful day.

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher\'s mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you\'re playing well and if not what you\'re doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nAndrew Neiman, a 19-year-old jazz drummer is determined to rise to the top of the country\'s most elite music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons, Juno), an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man\'s life. Andrew\'s passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability and his sanity.\r\n-\r\nLoft Cinema\r\n\r\nAndrew is a drummer and a first year student at the Schaffer Conservatory. He is selected by the school\'s senior instructor, Mr. Fletcher, to play on his studio band. Fletcher is - to say the least - a difficult and demanding task master who accepts and expects nothing less that perfection from his students. His methods of exacting the best from his students include belittling them, throwing objects at them and creating a level of tension so high that average individuals would likely crumble under the pressure. It leads Andrew to eventually quit but a surprise encounter with Fletcher gives him a chance to show just what he can accomplish - or to fail miserably.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nWith dreams of becoming one of the best jazz drummers in the world, Andrew Neiman enrols himself into a prestigious music conservatory. His ambition does not go unnoticed, and he is hand-picked, and mentored by the schools senior instructor, Fletcher. Andrew soon realises that Fletcher\'s terrifying methods will either make, or break him as an artist.\r\n-\r\nBecksyKane','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-20 02:40:40','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',18),(246,'1130884','Shutter Island','Shutter Island','Shutter Island\r\nLa isla siniestra\r\nIlha do Medo\r\nЗлокобен остров\r\n禁闭岛\r\nOtok Shutter\r\nProkletý ostrov\r\nSuletud saar\r\nSuljettu saari\r\nSheshlilta Kundzuli\r\nTo nisi ton kataramenon\r\nΤο νησί των καταραμένων\r\nViharsziget\r\nシャッター アイランド\r\nSlēgtā sala\r\nKuždesių sala\r\nWyspa tajemnic\r\nInsula Shutter\r\nОстров проклятых\r\nЗатворено острво\r\nPrekliaty ostrov\r\nZlovešči otok\r\n隔離島\r\nZindan Adası\r\nОстрів проклятих\r\nAshecliffe\r\nLa\'natlanganlar oroli\r\nLa Isla siniestra\r\nĐảo Kinh Hoàng',2010,138,8.2,1234042,'English\r\nGerman','United States','Mystery\r\nThriller','Martin Scorsese','Laeta Kalogridis\r\nDennis Lehane','Chris Brigham\r\nBradley J.

He\'s been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he\'s been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy\'s shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.\r\n-\r\nalfiehitchie\r\n\r\nFederal Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to a government-run institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island, near Boston, when there is a report that a prisoner has gone missing. Daniels, weighed down with his own baggage, has his own reasons for wanting to get to the island. He is still traumatized from what he saw when his army unit liberated one of the Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, and still haunted by his wife\'s more-recent death in a fire. The head of the hospital, Dr. John Cawley, treats him decently, but others give the agents a cooler reception. Daniels particularly wants to find out what goes on in the ward that\'s reserved for the most serious offenders. As he begins to peel away the layers of deceit, it becomes obvious that not all is as it seems.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nAssigned the thorny task of investigating the incomprehensible disappearance of a deranged child-murderess, troubled U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, travel to Ashecliffe Hospital: Shutter Island\'s impregnable asylum for the criminally insane. Soon, within the dark purgatory\'s thick stone walls, indescribable nuances of medical malpractice suggest that the institution\'s cryptic senior psychiatrists must be hiding something. Then, a raging tempest traps patients and investigators alike in the dark off-shore prison, triggering Teddy\'s crippling migraines and gruesome flashbacks of a haunting past. Is the already perplexed detective losing his grip on reality?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel from Seattle to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that the management by the Federal facility are obstructing his investigations. Severe migraines hit Teddy as a storm hits the island, and he and Chuck discover that they\'re stranded. Teddy interviews the internees and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery of Shutter Island.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-20 14:01:52','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16/13\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(247,'1136608','District 9','District 9','District 9\r\nSector 9\r\n9-cu Rayon\r\nDistrito 9\r\nСектор 9\r\nDistrikt 9\r\n9. rajoon\r\nDistrict 9 - Apagorevmeni periohi\r\nD-9異形禁區\r\n9-es körzet\r\nDai 9 chiku\r\n第9地区\r\n9.rajons\r\n9-asis rajonas\r\nDystrykt 9\r\nРайон No 9\r\nДистрикт 9\r\nOkrozje 9\r\n第九禁區\r\nYasak Bölge 9\r\nДев\'ятий округ\r\n9-hudud\r\nKhu vực 9\r\nDistrict Nine',2009,112,7.9,664476,'English\r\nNyanja\r\nAfrikaans\r\nZulu\r\nXhosa\r\nSotho','South Africa\r\nUnited States\r\nNew Zealand\r\nCanada','Action\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Neill Blomkamp','Neill Blomkamp\r\nTerri Tatchell','Bill Block\r\nPhilippa Boyens\r\nMark Brooke\r\nCarolynne Cunningham\r\nTrishia Downie\r\nElliot Ferwerda\r\nPaul Hanson\r\nPeter Jackson\r\nKen Kamins\r\nMichael S.

Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\n1980, West Texas. While out hunting down by the US-Mexico border, good ol\' Texas boy Llewelyn Moss, a welder by day who lives in a trailer park in Sanderson with his wife Carla Jean, comes across what is a drug deal gone wrong. What he finds are all the players left at the scene dead or near death and a satchel filled with $2 million which he takes, despite knowing that someone will be looking for the money and is probably willing to kill for it. As such, he not only tries to protect himself in the process of trying to find out who will be after the money, but also Carla Jean by sending her away. A person hired to retrieve the money is Anton Chigurh, who indeed will kill anyone, including innocent bystanders, necessary to get to his end goal, with a high pressure air pistol his weapon of choice especially as it leaves no bullet as evidence. Chigurh, in deciding who should live or die in his day to day life, also uses his own psychopathic set of principles. Chirgurh quickly learns that Moss has the money and is on the run. Also on both their trails is Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell and his naive deputy Wendell. Bell, a third generation sheriff, has of late contemplated his professional future solely because of the notion that he and his like have not been able to do anything to control the increasing violence of the region. Bell finds evidence that Moss has the money and that someone, who has left a trail of carnage behind him, is after Moss and the money. As such, Bell tries to find Moss solely to protect him from whoever is after him. One other person added to the mix is Carson Wells, hired by the same person that hired Chigurh also to retrieve the money, as their employer feels that Chigurh has gotten out of control. Wells knows Chigurh well and knows that he will not take too kindly to anyone else brought in on his job.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn the desert of Rio Grande, a drug deal goes wrong and Llewellyn Moss, the welder, finds 2 million dollars in a box. He keeps the money for himself but an unemotional psychopathic killer Chigurh chases him. He kills everyone that comes in front of him to get the welder, using a unique weapon of his own. By this time the elderly sheriff Ed Tom tries to go through and to as deed as possible of the matter.\r\n\r\nAfter stumbling across a case of money among dead bodies, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) thinks he can keep it quiet, but when silent killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) locates Moss and his money, Vietnam veteran Moss makes a run for it. With bodies falling everywhere Anton goes, it\'s only a matter of time before he catches up with Llewelyn. Whilst all this is going on, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is overseeing the investigation and begins to see the country in a different light than it once was.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUk\r\n\r\nAfter he finds $2 million in the desert where a drug deal has apparently gone wrong, working man Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds himself on the run. His pursuer is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an unemotional killer with a unique murder weapon at his disposal. Throughout, soon to be retired Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to convince Moss, mostly through his wife Carla Jean, that he should turn the money over to the authorities or this could all end in tragedy.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-20 14:06:27','','','','','',0,0,1,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-13\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::18\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::15A\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/18\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',16),(249,'8108198','Andhadhun','Andhadhun','Andhadhun\r\nAssassinato às Cegas\r\n调音师\r\nMud Mud Ke Na Dekh\r\n盲目のメロディ インド式殺人狂騒曲\r\n盲目のメロディ　インド式殺人狂騒曲\r\nAklasis pianistas\r\nСтреляйте в пианиста\r\nПуцајте у пијанисту\r\n看不見的旋律\r\nСтріляйте у піаніста\r\nاللحن الأعمى\r\nThe Blind Melody\r\nShoot the Piano Player',2018,139,8.2,87144,'Hindi\r\nEnglish','India','Comedy\r\nCrime\r\nMusic\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Sriram Raghavan','Arijit Biswas\r\nYogesh Chandekar\r\nSriram Raghavan\r\nHemanth M.

Later, all three unexpectedly find themselves working together in a joint mission to stop a private criminal organization from using Gaby\'s father\'s scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear bomb. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate for the sake of world peace, even as they each pursue their own agendas.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nIn the 60\'s, the CIA agent Napoleon Solo is assigned to bring the mechanic Gaby Teller from East Berlin to the other side of the wall. Gaby is the daughter of the scientist and American collaborator Udo Teller that defected from German at the end of WWII and now has vanished. They are chased by KGB agent Illya Kuryakin but they succeed to escape. Soon Napoleon Solo\'s chief Saunders discloses that Gaby\'s uncle Rudi works for the wealthy Alexander and his wife Victoria Vinciguerra and Udo might be secretly building a nuclear weapon for them. Napoleon Solo is forced to team-up with Illya and Gaby and they go to Rome to investigate.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\n1963, the height of the Cold War. In an unlikely alliance, a CIA agent, Napoleon Solo and KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin, band together to save the world from nuclear disaster. A top nuclear scientist, formerly employed by the US, has gone missing. It is suspected his brother has kidnapped him to work on a nuclear bomb. Solo and Kuryakin accompany the scientist\'s daughter, Gaby, to Rome, as this is where her uncle is based. The idea is to covertly investigate his company and, hopefully, find the scientist and the bomb. Things aren\'t all plain sailing though. This is heightened by the fact that Solo and Kuryakin aren\'t sure they can trust each other and, to some extent, still regard each other as enemies.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\n1963. Napoleon Solo is a suave and urbane C.I.A. agent. He was once a criminal, but the C.I.A. believed his unique talents would be of better service to the country as a spy than they would be if he was behind bars. His current case is to locate Dr. Udo Teller, a famed German rocket scientist who had been working for the Americans on their nuclear program since the end of WWII until he disappeared without a trace two years ago, that is until he was recently photographed in Rome. Napoleon manages to smuggle Teller\'s biological daughter, Gaby Schmidt, out of East Berlin to the west in order to locate Teller. The Americans don\'t believe she knows anything about his whereabouts - her father who she has not seen or heard from in eighteen years - but that she can influence some who do, namely her Uncle Rudi who is an executive at Rome-based Vinciguerra Shipping, owned and operated by husband and wife Alexander and Victoria Vinceguerra. The company is purportedly the front for the development of nuclear weapons, the major national intelligence agencies suspecting that Victoria, the brains behind the operation, having kidnapped Teller to build her an atom bomb. Because of the global implications, Napoleon is forced to work on this case with KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Beyond the east-west divide between the Americans and Soviets, Napoleon will have a difficult time working with his new partner due to their recent not so pleasant encounter in East Berlin, and Illya\'s volatile and violent temper, which can cloud what he does professionally. As Napoleon, Illya and Gaby work on the case - their success or failure which may determine world order - what happens is affected by other players in the picture which they do not know about, and the Americans and Soviets working arguably on their own different agendas.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nDuring the taut East-West relations and the volatile early-1960s Cold War climate, the former thief and now suave CIA agent, Napoleon Solo, manages to transport Gaby Teller, the daughter of an ex-Nazi scientist, from East Berlin to West Germany, as the KGB spy, Illya Kuryakin, is hot on their trail. However, before the imminent threat of a global nuclear Armageddon, America and the Soviet Union order the two operatives to join forces in an unprecedented joint mission. Now, Solo and Kuryakin will have to endure each other for the common good and hope that their frail truce lasts. Can they thwart the elusive adversary\'s plans, especially when both governments have hidden agendas?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-21 01:52:49','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(251,'5753856','Dark','Dark','Dark\r\nМрак\r\nΣκοτάδι\r\nSötétség\r\nI segreti di Winden\r\nダーク\r\nТьма\r\nТама\r\nTma\r\n闇\r\nKaranlık\r\nПітьма\r\nظلام\r\nZulmat\r\nĐêm Lặng',2017,60,8.8,343358,'German','Germany\r\nUnited States','Crime\r\nDrama\r\nMystery\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Baran bo Odar','Baran bo Odar\r\nJantje Friese\r\nJantje Friese\r\nMarc O.

Indeed, as this new type of invader is attracted to noise, even the slightest of sounds can be deadly; however, it\'s been already twelve months since the powerful monsters\' first sightings, and this resilient family still stands strong. Of course, learning the rules of survival in this muted dystopia is essential; nevertheless, now, of all times, an otherwise joyous event puts in jeopardy the already fragile stability. And now, more than ever, the Abbotts must not make a sound.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThe story of the young Abbott family is told starting on day eighty-nine of their ordeal. Unaware if anyone else on Earth is still alive besides them, they have to remain as silent as possible under most circumstances, which means no speaking, to evade deadly and seemingly indestructible armored creatures which track their targets solely by sound and which have led to the Abbotts\' solitary existence. This existence is made all the more difficult for eldest offspring Regan in being deaf and thus unable to gauge the issue of sound, which is why father, Lee, is constantly trying to devise ways to upgrade her cochlear implant if only for her survival. Under these circumstances, the family tries as best it can to lead as normal a life as possible with devised safeguards to protect them despite anything that may happen to them potentially to throw them off this routine of mock normalcy and survival. Through this ordeal, they also try to learn as much as they can about the creatures in the hope of someday being able to destroy them to regain their lives. For parents Lee and Evelyn, the first priority is protecting the children at all cost, which the children may not always see or understand especially concerning the day eighty-nine incident.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-21 03:11:18','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzechia::12\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::12A\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',18),(253,'4575576','Christopher Robin','Christopher Robin','Christopher Robin\r\nKristofer Robin\r\nChristopher Robin: Un reencuentro inolvidable\r\nJanneman Robinson & Poeh\r\nChristopher Robin: Um Reencontro Inesquecível\r\nИсторията на Кристофър Робин и Мечо Пух\r\nL\'histoire de Jean-Christophe\r\nDisney\'s Christopher Robin\r\nKrystůfek Robin\r\nJakob og Peter Plys\r\nChristopher Robin ja Karupoeg Puhh\r\nRisto Reipas ja Nalle Puh\r\nJean-Christophe & Winnie\r\nΚρίστοφερ & Γουίνι\r\nBarátom, Róbert Gida\r\nRitorno al Bosco dei 100 Acri\r\nRitorno al bosco dei 100 acri\r\nPooh to Otona ni Natta Boku\r\nI Became an Adult with Pooh\r\nプーと大人になった僕\r\nKristofers Robins\r\nJonukas\r\nChristopher Robin: un reencuentro inolvidable\r\nKristoffer Robin og Ole Brumm\r\nKrzysiu, gdzie jesteś?\r\nChristopher Robin si Winnie de Plus\r\nКристофер Робин\r\nКристофере Робине, где си?\r\nChristoffer Robin & Nalle Puh\r\n摯友維尼\r\nКрістофер Робін\r\nWinnie the Pooh',2018,104,7.3,74961,'English','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Animation\r\nAdventure\r\nComedy\r\nDrama\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy','Marc Forster','A.A.

When the Necromongers attack New Mecca, Riddick is captured by cocky bounty hunter Toombs (Nick Chinlund) and his crew, and he is transported to Crematoria, where he reunites with Jack, now named \"Kyra\" (Alexa Davalos). Riddick and Kyra escape to the planet\'s sun-ravaged surface, where Riddick, helped by Necromonger warrior Vaako (Karl Urban) and his sexy wife Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton), sets out to defeat the Lord Marshal and save the universe from his rule and save the rest of humanity from being converted into Nercomonger warriors.\r\n-\r\nDaniel Williamson','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-21 15:07:33','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::UA\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R13\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12',12),(257,'1411250','Riddick','Riddick','Riddick\r\nLa batalla de Riddick: Dead Man Stalking\r\nRiddick 3\r\nРидик\r\nLes Chroniques de Riddick: Domptez les Ténèbres\r\nRiddick - sobrevivir es su leyenda\r\nRiddick - sobrevivir es su venganza\r\nRiddick - paluu\r\nRiddick: Rule the Dark\r\nRiddick - Überleben ist seine Rache\r\nRidikku: Gyarakushî Batoru\r\nRiddick: Galaxy Battle\r\nリディック　ギャラクシー・バトル\r\nRidiks\r\nRydiko kronikos.

Activating an emergency beacon alerts two ships: one carrying a new breed of mercenary, the other captained by a man from Riddick\'s past.\r\n\r\nThe infamous Riddick has been left for dead on a sun-scorched planet that appears to be lifeless. Soon, however, he finds himself fighting for survival against alien predators more lethal than any human he\'s encountered. The only way off is for Riddick to activate an emergency beacon and alert mercenaries who rapidly descend to the planet in search of their bounty. The first ship to arrive carries a new breed of merc, more lethal and violent, while the second is captained by a man whose pursuit of Riddick is more personal. With time running out and a storm on the horizon that no one could survive, his hunters won\'t leave the planet without Riddick\'s head as their trophy.\r\n-\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\nBetrayed by the Necromongers and left for dead on a remote planet, Riddick learns to adapt to the harsh environment and rediscover his predatory instincts. When a more deadly threat appears on the horizon, he is forced to activate an emergency beacon attracting two ships: one filled with mercenaries, and another captained by a man with a personal vendetta against Riddick.\r\n-\r\nKCWP\r\n\r\nFive years after Kyra\'s death, Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and assassination attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve what he calls transcendence. Led by Vaako\'s aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-21 15:07:58','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14A\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16',18),(259,'0078748','Alien','Alien','Alien\r\nAlien - El octavo pasajero\r\nAlien, de achtste passagier\r\nAlien - O 8º Passageiro\r\nAlien: O Oitavo Passageiro\r\nПришълецът\r\nL\'étranger: le huitième passager\r\nAlien: Le huitième passager\r\n异形\r\nAlien: Osmi putnik\r\nVetřelec\r\nVotrelec\r\nAlien - Den 8. passager\r\nFazaei\r\nTulnukas\r\nAlien - den 8. passageraren\r\nAlien - kahdeksas matkustaja\r\nAlien - Le 8ème passager\r\nAlien, le huitième passager\r\nAlien: Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt\r\nAlien - Director\'s Cut\r\nΆλιεν, ο επιβάτης του διαστήματος\r\nΆλιεν\r\nA nyolcadik utas: a Halál\r\nBiganeh\r\nHa-Nose\'a HaShmini\r\nエイリアン\r\nSvešais\r\nSvetimas\r\nAlien, el 8° pasajero\r\nAlien (THE DIRECTOR\'S CUT)\r\nAlien: Den 8. passasjer\r\nObcy - 8. pasażer \'\'Nostromo\'\'\r\nAlien - O 8.º Passageiro\r\nЧужой\r\nОсми путник\r\nТуђин\r\nOsmi potnik\r\nAlien, el octavo pasajero\r\nAlien, el octavo pasajero: El montaje del director\r\nAlien - den åttonde passageraren\r\n異形\r\nYaratık\r\nЧужий\r\nStar Beast\r\nAlien: The Director\'s Cut\r\nBegona\r\nNgười Ngoài Hành Tinh\r\nAlien - Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt',1979,117,8.4,841901,'English','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Horror\r\nSci-Fi','Ridley Scott','Dan O\'Bannon\r\nDan O\'Bannon\r\nRonald Shusett','Gordon Carroll\r\nDavid Giler\r\nWalter Hill\r\nIvor Powell\r\nRonald Shusett','Jerry Goldsmith','Tom Skerritt\r\nSigourney Weaver\r\nVeronica Cartwright\r\nHarry Dean Stanton\r\nJohn Hurt\r\nIan Holm\r\nYaphet Kotto\r\nBolaji Badejo\r\nHelen Horton\r\nEddie Powell','In space no one can hear you scream.\r\n\r\nThe Scariest Movie Ever Made.

The crew are under obligation to investigate and the spaceship descends on the moon afterwards. After a rough landing, three crew members leave the spaceship to explore the area on the moon. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship\'s computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a distress call.

All alone in space, no one can hear them scream: trying to warn the rest of the galaxy of the terror that is the Xenomorph.\r\n-\r\nJohnny\r\n\r\nIn the depths of the cold, boundless space, Mother, the state-of-the-art AI super-computer aboard the commercial towing vehicle, USCSS Nostromo, detects a possible distress signal from the nearby barren, inhospitable moon, Acheron, and awakens the seven-member crew from cryosleep. To investigate the mysterious transmission, Captain Arthur Dallas, along with the executive officer, Thomas Kane, and navigator, Joan Lambert, descend to the dim-lit celestial body known as LV-426, only to discover a downed but relatively intact extraterrestrial spacecraft, and its bizarre cargo. But, was this cryptic signal, indeed, a desperate SOS, or was it a warning? Either way, somehow, something else, too, has found its way into the Nostromo, and now, its silent, dark corridors will never be safe again. Who dares to confront the formidable Alien, the unwanted eighth passenger?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, during her return to Earth, the commercial spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress call from a distant moon. The seven-member crew are awakened from hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the moon. While exploring the moon, a three-member team of the crew discover a derelict spaceship and a huge chamber inside her containing thousands of eggs. When a curious team member goes near the egg, the parasite inside the egg attacks him, rendering him unconscious. He is brought back aboard and the spaceship takes off. After a little while, the parasite dies and his host wakes up seemingly unruffled.

Along with a crew of space pirates, she must again battle the deadly aliens and stop them from reaching Earth.\r\n\r\nThe saga continues 200 years after Ripley sacrificed herself for the sake of humanity. Her erstwhile employers long gone, this time it is the military that resurrects the one-woman killing machine through genetic cloning to extract the alien from within her, but during the process her DNA is fused with the queen and then the aliens escape. Now Ripley must decide where her allegiance lies.\r\n\r\nIt\'s been two long centuries since Ellen Ripley\'s selfless sacrifice in Alien³ (1992), and now, military scientists of the top-secret scientific research vessel, USM Auriga, have successfully managed to clone her by creating Ripley 8. However, as the dormant embryonic Xenomorph Queen that had been growing inside her imbues the human/alien hybrid with immense strength and fragmented inherited memories, in the meantime, Captain Frank Elgyn of the smuggling ship, Betty, sets foot on the Auriga with his ragtag team of mercenaries. Somehow, aggressive Xenomorphs escape, and now, the genetically enhanced Ripley must pick sides. Is the world prepared for the imminent Alien resurrection?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nEllen Ripley sacrificed herself to destroy the Company\'s desires to use the alien queen as a biological weapon. 200 years and seven horrible experiments later, she is resurrected on the USM Auriga using blood samples from Fiorina 161, for the purpose of extracting the alien queen inside her. However, Ripley\'s DNA gets mixed up with the Queen\'s DNA and she begins to develop enhanced strength and reflexes. After a band of smugglers, hired by the government, bring the crew of a hijacked transport to the Auriga, all hell breaks loose when the aliens breed from the hijacked crew escape. When the Auriga is set on automatic pilot back to Earth, it\'s up to Ripley and the smugglers to stop the Auriga and escape with their lives. And when the Queen\'s secret was revealed, it exposed a bizarre DNA mix-up that left both Ripley and the queen\'s genetics intertwined; giving light to an alien that could spell doom for Earth.\r\n-\r\nKerwin Tsang\r\n\r\nIt is 200 years since Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself to destroy the alien queen on Fiorina 161. Ripley\'s former employers, the Weyland-Yutani Company has dissolved and now the United Systems Military has assumed the task of breeding and harnessing the deadly aliens. With blood samples taken from her previous life, scientists clone a new Ripley in order to extract the alien queen inside of her. The new Ripley, known as Number 8, acquires physical and emotional traits from both humanity and the aliens, making her question where her allegiances lie. Shortly after, the aliens break free and commence killing those onboard. Along with a crew of smugglers that unknowingly helped in delivering hosts to breed the alien species, Ripley must now escape the perilous ship. Along the way, Ripley encounters a shocking revelation that truly sets herself against both humanity and the alien species. She must now decide what she truly is, in order to save humanity once more.\r\n-\r\nChris Broz','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-27 13:18:56','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM18\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSaudi Arabia::R15\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::TV-PG',18),(261,'2316204','Alien: Covenant','Alien: Covenant','Alien: Covenant\r\nVanzemaljac: Saveznik\r\nПришълецът: Завет\r\nPrometej 2\r\nAlien: Savez\r\nVetřelec: Covenant\r\nFazaei: ahd\r\nBiganeh: peyman\r\nHa\'nos\'e\'ah ha\'shmini: covenant\r\nエイリアン　コヴェナント\r\nSvešais: Covenant\r\nSvetimas: Covenant\r\nObcy: Przymierze\r\nExtraterestrii: Pactul\r\nAlien: Pactul\r\nЧужой: Завет\r\nOsmi putnik: Kovenant\r\nОсми путник: Ковенант\r\nPrometheus 2\r\nVotrelec: Covenant\r\nOsmi potnik: Zaveza\r\n異形：聖約\r\nYaratık: Covenant\r\nЧужий: Заповіт\r\nAlien: Paradise Lost\r\nQuái Vật Không Gian',2017,122,6.4,271194,'English','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom','Horror\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Ridley Scott','Dan O\'Bannon\r\nRonald Shusett\r\nJack Paglen\r\nMichael Green\r\nJohn Logan\r\nDante Harper','David Giler\r\nAmy Greene\r\nWalter Hill\r\nMark Huffam\r\nHannah Ireland\r\nTeresa Kelly\r\nMichael Schaefer\r\nRidley Scott','Jed Kurzel','Michael Fassbender\r\nKatherine Waterston\r\nBilly Crudup\r\nDanny McBride\r\nDemián Bichir\r\nCarmen Ejogo\r\nJussie Smollett\r\nCallie Hernandez\r\nAmy Seimetz\r\nNathaniel Dean\r\nAlexander England\r\nBenjamin Rigby\r\nUli Latukefu\r\nTess Haubrich\r\nLorelei King\r\nGoran D.

But, under everyone\'s noses, a stealthy Xenomorph manages to escape and mature in the vast correctional facility\'s labyrinthine ventilation-duct system, and as it picks off the unprotected inmates, mass hysteria starts to spread.

The prison does not allow weapons of any kind, and with help being a long time away, the prisoners must simply survive in any way they can. When help does arrive, the true intentions of the Company becomes clear. While living on the prison planet until she is rescued by her employers, Ripley discovers the horrifying reason for her crash: An alien stowaway.

But this time, the aliens have taken over a space colony on the moon LV-426. When the colonial marines are called upon to search the deserted space colony, they later find out that they are up against more than what they bargained for. Using specially modified machine guns and enough firepower, it\'s either fight or die as the space marines battle against the aliens. As the Marines do their best to defend themselves, Ripley must attempt to protect a young girl who is the sole survivor of the nearly wiped out space colony.\r\n-\r\nblazesnakes9\r\n\r\nLiving in a state of suspended animation for the past fifty-seven years, the sole survivor of the bloody Nostromo massacre in Alien (1979), Lieutenant First Class Ellen Ripley, wakes up in a salvage ship on its way back to Earth. Now, faced with the consequences of her actions, disgraced Ripley reluctantly accepts to escort the junior executive, Carter Burke, along with a tough-as-nails squad of U.S. Colonial Marines to Hadley\'s Hope, the terraforming and mining colony on LV-426, in exchange for her pilot\'s licence. But, there, on the dark surface of the remote exoplanetary satellite, multitudes of predatory endoparasitoid creatures known as Xenomorphs, just like the aggressive Stage 3 drone that killed Ellen\'s companions, prowl the area. This time, it\'s war, and as the undaunted, acid-spewing space-insects decimate the armed-to-the-teeth troops, once more, Ripley must take her life into her own hands. Can a woman alone put an end to the nightmare of the ferocious Aliens?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIn James Cameron\'s superb sequel to Alien (1979), Sigourney Weaver returns to civilization and is recruited to rescue a space colony on the planet where the first alien reigned. Only one small girl has survived--but a whole nest of \'them\' is waiting for new prey. Hellbent on saving the child, Weaver takes on the alien leader, a female protecting her young, in a fight to the death.\r\n\r\nFifty-seven years after surviving an apocalyptic attack aboard her space vessel by merciless space creatures, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakens from hyper-sleep and tries to warn anyone who will listen about the predators. Although she is ignored at first, when contact with colonists on a planet thought safe is suddenly lost, Ripley and a military team are sent to confront the aliens.\r\n\r\nEllen Ripley, the sole survivor of the alien attack on the mining ship Nostromo, awakens 57 years later when she is found by a salvage vessel. The welcome given to her by the Company officials is far from warm, since they refuse to believe her discovery of alien existence and revoke her flight officer\'s license. Much to her horror, Ripley also discovers that the moon LV-426 where her crew had encountered an alien species for the first time, is now colonized by the Company. But when all contact from the moon is lost, Ripley is called back into action again as an advisor to a team of tough space marines with a great deal of firepower. To get rid of her recurrent nightmares about the alien creature, Ripley prepares for a final battle with the monsters - and this time, there are hundreds of them out there.\r\n-\r\nSoumitra','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-27 13:21:16','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::13\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::14\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R12\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::TV-PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nWest Germany::16',18),(264,'0478970','Ant-Man','Ant-Man','Ant-Man\r\nAnt-Man: El Hombre Hormiga\r\nHomem-Formiga\r\nАнт-Мен\r\nEl Hombre Hormiga\r\nSipelgamees\r\nA Hangya\r\nAntman\r\nアントマン\r\nSkudrcilvēks\r\nSkruzdėliukas\r\nAnt-Man: El hombre hormiga\r\nAnt-Man 3D\r\nOmul-Furnica\r\nЧеловек-муравей\r\nЧовек-мрав\r\nАнтмен\r\n蟻人\r\nЛюдина-мураха\r\nAnt Man\r\nChumoli-odam\r\nNgười Kiến',2015,117,7.3,629243,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nComedy\r\nSci-Fi','Peyton Reed','Edgar Wright\r\nJoe Cornish\r\nAdam McKay\r\nPaul Rudd\r\nEdgar Wright\r\nJoe Cornish\r\nStan Lee\r\nLarry Lieber\r\nJack Kirby','Victoria Alonso\r\nLouis D\'Esposito\r\nKevin Feige\r\nAlan Fine\r\nDavid J.

When he steals a powerful suit, he quickly returns it only to find himself arrested again. But a mysterious man named Hank Pym has other ideas for him.

They believe Pym\'s wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantum entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her. With only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang\'s actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer Sonny Burch, who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym\'s research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantum unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"ghost\", but the woman escapes with Pym\'s lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-27 13:25:20','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::8\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMalta::PG\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::12A\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::7-9\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C13',12),(266,'1477834','Aquaman','Aquaman','Aquaman\r\nPosejdon\r\nČovek iz vode\r\nАквамен\r\n海王\r\nSamuthira Puthiran\r\nSamudra Putrudu\r\nアクアマン\r\nAkvamens\r\nAkvamenas\r\nAkvamen\r\n水行俠\r\nAhab\r\nAquaman: Đế Vương Atlantis',2018,143,6.9,431189,'English\r\nRussian\r\nMaori\r\nItalian','United States\r\nAustralia','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFantasy\r\nSci-Fi','James Wan','David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick\r\nWill Beall\r\nGeoff Johns\r\nJames Wan\r\nWill Beall\r\nPaul Norris\r\nMort Weisinger','Khadija Alami\r\nJon Berg\r\nRob Cowan\r\nWalter Hamada\r\nGeoff Johns\r\nMark O\'Neill\r\nPeter Safran\r\nEnzo Sisti\r\nDeborah Snyder\r\nZack Snyder','Rupert Gregson-Williams','Jason Momoa\r\nAmber Heard\r\nWillem Dafoe\r\nPatrick Wilson\r\nNicole Kidman\r\nDolph Lundgren\r\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II\r\nTemuera Morrison\r\nLudi Lin\r\nMichael Beach\r\nRandall Park\r\nGraham McTavish\r\nLeigh Whannell\r\nTainui Kirkwood\r\nTamor Kirkwood\r\nDenzel Quirke\r\nKaan Guldur\r\nOtis Dhanji\r\nKekoa Kekumano\r\nJulie Andrews\r\nJohn Rhys-Davies\r\nDjimon Hounsou\r\nAndrew Crawford\r\nSophia Forrest\r\nNatalia Safran\r\nMicah Ohlman\r\nJack Andrew\r\nFrankie Creagh-Leslie\r\nSophia Emberson-Bain\r\nIlya Melnikoff\r\nHank Amos\r\nKyryl Koltsov\r\nPatrick Cox\r\nLuke Owen\r\nRobert Longstreet\r\nDevika Parikh\r\nSonny Le\r\nJon Fabian\r\nMabel Tamone\r\nRita Dinardo\r\nAnthony Standish\r\nNicolette Bianca\r\nVictor Leto\r\nVincent B.

The police dispense the crowd and Umberto returns to his cheap furnished room which he shares with his dog Flick. Umberto\'s lone friend is Maria, servant of the boarding house. She is a simple girl who is pregnant by one of two soldiers and neither will admit to being the father. When Umberto\'s landlady Antonia demands the rent owed her and threatens eviction if she is not paid, Umberto tries desperately to raise the money by selling his books and watch. He is too proud to beg in the streets and can not get a loan from any of his acquaintances. He contracts a sore throat, is admitted to a hospital and this puts a delay on his financial difficulty. Discharged, he finds that his dog is gone and, following a frantic search, locates him in the city dog pound. His room has been taken over by the landlady and the now-homeless Unberto determines to find a place for his beloved dog, and then kill himself. Unsuccessful, he resolves that his dog must die with him and he stands in the path of a train, with his dog in his arms.\r\n-\r\nLes Adams\r\n\r\nUmberto Domenico Ferrari is a retired civil servant who can barely eke out a living on his meager pension. He\'s behind on his rent and is now threatened with eviction. His only friends are his dog Flike and the young Maria who works as a kitchen maid in his rooming house. He\'s taken to selling what few possessions he has - his watch, a pair of cherished books - to pay part of his back rent, but the landlady, Olga, insists he must pay her all he owes or she will evict him at the end of the month. Young Maria is pregnant, though she doesn\'t which of the two she\'s been seeing is the father, and Umberto offers to help. When Umberto falls ill, and he soon finds himself in hospital where he is found to have tonsillitis. He returns to his boarding house to find himself without a place to stay and learns that his dog has run off. He finds Flike at the pound but must now rebuild his life.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nAfter working thirty years as a dedicated civil servant, Umberto Domenico Ferrari lives solely off a meager Italian government pension. While most pensioners decry the small amount of money from the government, most are unlike Umberto who is in debt, the pension unable to pay off those debts and provide a healthy life for him. He is all alone in the world with no family. His only friends are his dog, a mutt named Flike, and Maria, the young, single maid who works in the house in which he\'s rented a room for twenty years. Umberto is close to being evicted by his haughty landlady, Olga, for rent not paid, she who has ulterior motives for wanting him out beyond the money. He has until the end of the month to come up with 15.000 lire for current and back rent or be evicted. Maria cannot help him, she who has her own secret which she confides to him, that issue which threatens her own position in the house. So Umberto does whatever he can either to raise the money, which is primarily through selling whatever of his possessions are worth anything monetarily, or cutting back on other expenses. One way he is able to achieve the latter is to parlay off of a case of tonsillitis. Through the process of this basic survival, Umberto will have to make some difficult and often heart wrenching decisions.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nBarely managing to support himself and his bright-eyed dog, Flike, Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a respectable civil servant who depends on his meagre and piteous pension, faces eviction by the end of the month. Under those circumstances, the desperate for cash lonely pensioner fights a losing battle to come by with the fifteen thousand lire to pay off his greedy and ruthless landlady, balancing between dignity and shame in the bustling streets of Rome. Now, Umberto\'s mind is clouded with grimly unpleasant thoughts, but is this the solution to his problems?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nUmberto Domenico Ferrari, an elderly and retired civil servant, is desperately trying to maintain a decent standard of living on a rapidly dwindling state pension, but he\'s up against his tyrannical landlady, who keeps demanding rent that he can\'t pay (while renting his room out to prostitutes during the day).

When danger befalls them and they end up kidnapped by robbers who are in over their heads, Benji and his scruffy sidekick come to the rescue.\r\n\r\nBENJI is a remake of the popular 1974 movie. It\'s a family-friendly movie about the love between a stray dog and two children who recently lost their father. This action-adventure movie is full of suspense and holds the viewer\'s attention throughout the story. After the pound takes Benji\'s mother, Benji is left an orphan. He lives on the streets, finding food and rest wherever he can. Through a long journey and a string of sneaky, comical scenes hiding in furniture on the back of a pick-up-truck, he makes his way to the city where he meets Carter. The boy buys some strawberries and tries to feed the dog, but Benji is timid and doesn\'t know whom to trust. He runs to hide in a hole in the side of the building. The boy leaves the strawberries there. Benji realizes the boy isn\'t dangerous and follows Carter and his sister, Frankie, home. He climbs up a set of stairs and appears in their window. Carter and Frankie let the dog inside. They gave him a bath and play with him all afternoon. When their mom comes home, they hide Benji with their stuffed animals so she won\'t notice he\'s there. The next morning, when their mom comes to wake the kids for school, it startles Benji and he barks at her. She freaks out when she discovers her children have brought a stray dog in the house. She demands them to get rid of it. On a sad, rainy day, Carter puts Benji back on the streets. Flash forward to Carter and Frankie stopping by a pawnshop to try to buy their father\'s watch their mom had to sell for money. When they arrive, a robbery is taking place and the store-owner is being held hostage. One of the robbers loses his mask in the process, and the children see his face. Frightened they may reveal his face to authorities; the robbers capture the children and throw them in a van. Benji, who has been following the children since they put him back on the streets, follows the van to an abandoned house. He runs back to the city and through a determined set of attempts he convinces their mom, the police and another scruffy street dog to follow him. Can they rescue the children in time?

The 6-term authoritarian mayor of Megasaki City, Kenji Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dog flu. The first dog to be exiled is Spots, a white and black-speckled pink-nosed dog who served as the bodyguard of Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari steals a plane and flies to Trash Island to search for Spots. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a pack of dogs led by a seemingly black dog named Chief, who is a former stray. The pack decides to help Atari locate Spots, although Chief refuses to join because of his inability to fraternize with humans.

When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely, and certainly unwanted, visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy\'s passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.\r\n-\r\nOrange\r\n\r\nWhen a rat named Remy gets washed away from his family, he ends up in Paris and goes into Gusteau\'s restaurant and meets a garbage boy named Linguini. A bunch of other chefs give him credit and give him a cooking job after thinking he made a soup delicious. Then Linguini takes Remy to the restaurant the next day. And Remy ends up controlling Linguini by pulling his hair. Can Remy be a great chef? and can Gusteau\'s be the greatest restaurant in Paris?\r\n\r\nRemy, a resident of Paris, appreciates good food and has quite a sophisticated palate. He would love to become a chef so he can create and enjoy culinary masterpieces to his heart\'s delight. The only problem is, Remy is a rat.

As Remy enters, so does Linguini, a clumsy youth hired as a garbage boy. To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls, Remy throws in some ingredients; the soup is a success and Linguini\'s career as a chef is born. Can Remy find a way to maintain the fiction and use his gift?\r\n-\r\n\r\nRemy is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy, who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young Remy. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy\'s family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.\r\n-\r\nswansongang','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-30 00:46:37','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nBulgaria::A\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::R\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::7\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::0\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::G\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::0\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::G\r\nVietnam::P',0),(280,'5116302','Togo','Togo','Togo\r\nТого\r\n多哥\r\nTogo - Una grande amicizia\r\n雪橇犬多哥\r\nТоґо',2019,113,8,45601,'English','United States','Adventure\r\nBiography\r\nDrama\r\nFamily\r\nHistory','Ericson Core','Tom Flynn','David S.

His bossy, jealous wife Cate initially makes Parker swear it won\'t stay, but by the time its\' clear nobody will claim him and an adoption candidate is found, she agrees to keep the dog, who won over their daughter Andy and her fiance Michael at first sight. Parker\'s Japanese college friend Ken inspires naming the pup Hachi(ko), and is pleasantly surprised when Parker successfully tackles the challenge to get it to fetch, which Akitas don\'t usually do. Hachi makes a habit of waiting for his equally doting master at the station every evening, but after a cardiac crisis, Parker dies. Hachi refuses to accept this, being moved to Michael\'s home as Cate moves out, waiting for a master who can never come home again, by now collectively adopted by sympathizing town-folk. The story is told in flashbacks as class assignment \'my hero\' by Michael\'s teen son Robbie, who also gets an Akita puppy.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nA schoolboy reports on his hero: Hachiko, his grandfather\'s dog. In a flashback, a puppy at a Japanese monastery is crated and sent to the US. The crate\'s tag tears, and when the puppy pushes his way out of the crate at the train station of a small Rhode Island town, Parker Wilson, a professor of music in nearby Providence, takes the dog home for the night. His wife isn\'t happy about it, but after failing to find the owner, she lets the dog stay. A Japanese friend reads the dog\'s tag - \"Hachiko\" or \"Eight,\" a lucky number. Parker can\'t teach the dog to fetch, but the friend explains that the dog will forge a different kind of loyalty. Tragedy tests that loyalty.\r\n-\r\n\r\nEleven year old Robbie is giving an oral class report on the topic of \"My Hero\", his chosen subject, Hachi, who on the surface is an unusual choice. Several years earlier, Parker Wilson, who lives in Bedridge in suburban New York City, is a college music/performing arts professor, he who makes the train commute to/from the city every working day. It is on one of those routine days going home that he finds at the Bedridge Station a puppy, who he eventually will learn was being shipped somewhere unknown, with the shipping tag lost. He also learns from Ken, a Japanese professor friend, that the dog is a Japanese breed called an Akita, and that the Japanese character on the dog\'s collar tag is the number eight - \"hachi\". Parker does whatever he can to find out who the dog belongs to, and although his many acquaintances around the train station do their small part in helping Parker, no one is willing to take the dog, even temporarily. So Parker takes the dog home, despite he and his wife Cate long having dismissed the idea of having a dog. However Parker is able to convince her to let the dog stay temporarily. Eventually on the high probability that they will never find the dog\'s owner, Cate, upon seeing the interaction between the two, lets Parker permanently keep the dog, who he has since named Hachi. Although living in the Wilson home with Parker, Cate and their daughter Andy, Hachi becomes not a Wilson family pet, not Cate\'s, not Andy\'s, but Parker\'s alone as a special bond forms between the two. Although not a \"typical\" dog in that Hachi will do not what most dogs do such as fetch, Hachi demonstrates an unwavering and lifelong loyalty to Parker in an unusual way that all around him can see. Robbie chose Hachi as his hero because of this loyalty, despite he never having met Parker, who in nonetheless an important part of his life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nBefore the entire class, young Ronnie tells the story of his grandfather\'s exceptional Akita dog. As Ronnie starts to recount the chance encounter of his grandfather, the college music teacher, Parker Wilson, with the abandoned puppy that accidentally ended up in the professor\'s hometown of Rhode Island, an incredible story of loyalty and devotion begins to unfold. Indeed, at first, Parker intended to find the dog\'s owner; but, instead, after realising that nobody claims the dog, he decided to keep the abandoned puppy, naming it Hachiko. Then, tragedy struck, giving the perfect example of the strong, the unwavering, and sometimes, the unexplainable bond that can form between a man and an animal.\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-05-01','','2020-04-30 00:49:19','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::G\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIndia::18\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNorway::7\r\nPoland::7\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::7\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16D',0),(283,'0903747','Breaking Bad','Breaking Bad','Breaking Bad\r\nBreaking Bad: A Química do Mal\r\nВ обувките на Сатаната\r\nNa putu prema dolje\r\nPerníkový táta\r\nHalvale teele\r\nTotál szívás\r\nBad Biari\r\nShover shurot\r\nBreaking Bad - Reazioni collaterali\r\nBureikingu baddo\r\nブレイキング・バッド\r\nPārkāpt robežu\r\nBręstantis blogis\r\nRuptura Total\r\nBreaking bad\r\nВо все тяжкие\r\nЧиста хемија\r\nPerníkový tatko\r\nKriva pota\r\nRompiendo Tus Límites Morales\r\n絕命毒師\r\nПуститися берега\r\nاختلال ضال\r\nEgrilik sari\r\nTập Làm Người Xấu',2008,49,9.4,1661799,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Crime\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Michelle MacLaren\r\nAdam Bernstein\r\nVince Gilligan\r\nColin Bucksey\r\nMichael Slovis\r\nBryan Cranston\r\nTerry McDonough\r\nJohan Renck\r\nRian Johnson\r\nScott Winant\r\nPeter Gould\r\nTricia Brock\r\nBronwen Hughes\r\nTim Hunter\r\nJim McKay\r\nPhil Abraham\r\nJohn Dahl\r\nFélix Enríquez Alcalá\r\nCharles Haid\r\nPeter Medak\r\nJohn Shiban\r\nDavid Slade\r\nGeorge Mastras\r\nThomas Schnauz\r\nSam Catlin','Vince Gilligan\r\nVince Gilligan\r\nPeter Gould\r\nPeter Gould\r\nGeorge Mastras\r\nGeorge Mastras\r\nSam Catlin\r\nMoira Walley-Beckett\r\nMoira Walley-Beckett\r\nThomas Schnauz\r\nGennifer Hutchison\r\nJohn Shiban\r\nJ.

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver\'s story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan\'s biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nRiggan is a man struggling to make his mark in the world. Having achieved fame as \"Birdman\", he voluntarily walked away from the on screen role, and battled the inner voices that had him believe he was more powerful than anyone could imagine. Old, irrelevant, but still driven, Riggan has chosen to pursue his dream of honoring the man who inspired him over 20 years ago. Riggan and those around him are all facing similar battles, but seem to be unaware of any but their own. Determined to make his play a success, he overcomes obstacle after obstacle in order to ensure it is a success on the stage. Surrounded by his daughter and the actors he\'s chosen, Riggan works to come to terms with the realities of life. Moments of brutal honesty affect him and those around him. Nearly everyone finds themselves in both positions, of giving and receiving the words they need to hear in that moment. Riggan attempts to let himself truly feel what he needs to so he can find inner peace and freedom. Opening night finds him offering the performance of his life for more reasons than one, and the success of that night will make or break the future of his play. Like everything else, his handling of events is affected by demons only he is aware of.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nRiggan Thomson is an actor who played the famous and iconic superhero \"Birdman\" over 20 years ago. Now, in his middle-age, he is directing his debut on Broadway, a drama called \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", an adaptation from a Raymond Carver story. With the help of his assistant and daughter Sam, and his producer Jake, he will play out the show previews, even when a talented actor he hired on, Mike Shiner act arbitrarily, the internal issues between him and the other casts, his useless maximum efforts to critics, and the unexpected voices of his old character- the Birdman, pushing his sanity until the first debut show.\r\n-\r\nGusde\r\n\r\nFormer cinema superhero Riggan Thomson is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It\'s risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he\'s a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a cast mate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nA washed-up actor is confronted with turbulent family drama, pretentious co-stars, and malicious critics as he attempts to write, direct, and star in his own Broadway production and escape the shadow of his former film alter-ego, Birdman.\r\n-\r\nwjones020','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-08','','2020-05-06 04:34:32','','http://fina.dyndns.tv/Peliculas/Birdman.mkv','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/14\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nVietnam::C18',12),(285,'5727208','Uncut Gems','Uncut Gems','Uncut Gems\r\nDiamantes en bruto\r\nNeobrađeni dragulji\r\nJoias Brutas\r\nНешлифовани диаманти\r\n原钻\r\nDrahokam\r\nHiomattomat timantit\r\nDer schwarze Diamant\r\nΆκοπο διαμάντι\r\nCsiszolatlan gyémánt\r\nDiamanti grezzi\r\nアンカット・ジェムズ\r\nアンカット・ダイヤモンド\r\nNeapdorotos brangenybės\r\nNieoszlifowane diamenty\r\nDiamante Bruto\r\nНеогранённые алмазы\r\nНеобрађени драгуљи\r\n原鑽\r\nPhet Son Liam\r\nНеограновані коштовності\r\nKim Cương Trong Đá',2019,135,7.4,257697,'English\r\nHebrew','United States','Crime\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Benny Safdie\r\nJosh Safdie','Ronald Bronstein\r\nJosh Safdie\r\nBenny Safdie','Michael Bartol\r\nSebastian Bear-McClard\r\nOscar Boyson\r\nEli Bush\r\nCatherine Farrell\r\nValentia Fisher\r\nIrfaan Fredericks\r\nJacob Jaffke\r\nAnthony Katagas\r\nDavid Koplan\r\nScott Rudin\r\nMartin Scorsese\r\nEmma Tillinger Koskoff','Daniel Lopatin','Mesfin Lamengo\r\nSun Zhi Hua-Hilton\r\nLiang Wei-Hui-Duncan\r\nSunny Wu Jin Zahao\r\nDeneke Muhugeta\r\nHabtunu Africho\r\nWarren Finkelstein\r\nAdam Sandler\r\nKeith William Richards\r\nTommy Kominik\r\nLaKeith Stanfield\r\nMaksud Agadjani\r\nCa$h Out\r\nAndrea Linsky\r\nRoman Persits\r\nPom Klementieff\r\nJulia Fox\r\nPaloma Elsesser\r\nMike Francesa\r\nSean Ringgold\r\nJeremy Sample\r\nTodd Vulpio\r\nKevin Garnett\r\nDemany Eastman\r\nGerard McQuiller\r\nArthur Borukhov\r\nDamien Howard\r\nJonathan Aranbayev\r\nRonald Greenberg\r\nMarshall Greenberg\r\nMichael A.

From Harlan\'s disfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan\'s untimely death.\r\n-\r\nLionsgate\r\n\r\nNothing could blemish the otherwise lavish birthday party at the palatial estate of the acclaimed crime/mystery novelist, Harlan Thrombey, except for his strange and unaccountable death. Now, the sharp knife in the silver-haired deceased\'s hand is a dead giveaway that something, or someone, had been bothering Harlan; nevertheless, the cryptic detective, Benoit Blanc, is not entirely sure. Indeed, there is more than one member of the successful author\'s clingy family who has been economical with the truth so far--and as Blanc struggles to shed light on a tangled mess of half-baked leads and little white lies--all eyes are on the grand prize: Harlan\'s magnificent legacy. Can Benoit get to the bottom of this perplexing case before someone else dies, too?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThe morning after his eighty-fifth birthday party held at his Norfolk County mansion with his dysfunctional family of his mother, his surviving children, their spouses, and their children in attendance, successful novelist and publishing house owner Harlan Thrombey, self-made in his wealth, is discovered in his attic study by Fran, one of the housekeepers, him dead with his throat slashed, knife in hand. Arguably the last person to see him alive was his Brazilian nurse, Marta Cabrera, the daughter of an illegal immigrant, something she has told few within this sphere. She went through her evening ritual of playing a game of Go with him and administering his medication at that time. A week later following the funeral, the local police are questioning the family members at the mansion to see what happened that night that could have led to his death, the questioning in their belief that Harlan committed suicide. The interviewees all confirm the time-line of events supporting that suicide belief. One other person at each of the interviews is famed private detective Benoit Blanc, who the family will learn has been retained as a consultant. What he fails to tell them in return is that he was hired anonymously, cash in advance. Blanc is able to bait many of the interviewees into bad mouthing other family members while being reticent to admit something that Blanc already seems to know about them, each of the family members looking out solely for him/herself. The key interview, one that happens unexpectedly, may be with Marta, who Blanc suspects was Harlan\'s confidante and who cannot lie in always having the physical reaction of vomiting whenever she does. One person not interviewed in being absent is one of Harlan\'s grandchildren, overly privileged Ransom Drysdale, who left the party early after having had a private conversation with his grandfather, he not being interviewed somewhat immaterial as Ransom was known to have not been at the mansion at the time of death. The nature of the investigation changes a week later at the reading of the will, where all will discover but some who were already aware that Harlan had rewritten it the week before his death, the specific changes not known until this day. With all these comings and goings, learning the full truth of what happened with Harlan may come down to discovering the unknown of who hired Blanc and why.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-06 13:32:40','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nPuerto Rico::PG-13\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(289,'2737304','Bird Box','Bird Box','Bird Box\r\nBird Box: A ciegas\r\nCaixa de Pássaros\r\nКутия за птици\r\nFroid aux yeux\r\nV pasti\r\nBird Box: Schließe deine Augen\r\nΜε τα Μάτια Κλειστά\r\nMadarak a dobozban\r\nバード・ボックス\r\nBird box: a ciegas\r\nNie otwieraj oczu\r\nÀs Cegas\r\nBird Box: Orbeste\r\nПтичий короб\r\nКутија за птице\r\nNeotváraj oči\r\nA ciegas\r\n蒙上你的眼\r\nПташиний короб\r\nQush qutisi\r\nLồng Chim',2018,124,6.6,317888,'English','United States','Horror\r\nSci-Fi','Susanne Bier','Eric Heisserer\r\nJosh Malerman','Susanne Bier\r\nSandra Bullock\r\nDylan Clark\r\nMark Cotone\r\nAinsley Davies\r\nAlexa Faigen\r\nEric Heisserer\r\nKelly Helstrom\r\nRyan Lewis\r\nChris Morgan\r\nClayton Townsend','Trent Reznor\r\nAtticus Ross','Sandra Bullock\r\nTrevante Rhodes\r\nJohn Malkovich\r\nSarah Paulson\r\nJacki Weaver\r\nRosa Salazar\r\nDanielle Macdonald\r\nLil Rel Howery\r\nTom Hollander\r\nMachine Gun Kelly\r\nBD Wong\r\nPruitt Taylor Vince\r\nVivien Lyra Blair\r\nJulian Edwards\r\nParminder Nagra\r\nRebecca Pidgeon\r\nAmy Gumenick\r\nTaylor Handley\r\nHappy Anderson\r\nKyle Beatty\r\nAshley Alva\r\nDavid Dastmalchian\r\nKeith Jardine\r\nKristopher Logan\r\nShirley Butler\r\nAden Calderon\r\nChanon Finley\r\nFrank Mottek\r\nDanny Max\r\nDebra Mark\r\nJonathan Chase\r\nSheri Davis\r\nRick L.

But 37 hours later and without a single lead, David decides to search the one place no one has looked yet, where all secrets are kept today: his daughter\'s laptop. In a hyper-modern thriller told via the technology devices we use every day to communicate, David must trace his daughter\'s digital footprints before she disappears forever.\r\n\r\nDirector Aneesh Chaganty\'s laptop thriller follows the the everyday life of the family through home videos and video chat footage.

One night, Margot goes to a friend\'s house for her study-group. The next morning, David is unable to reach Margot but assumes she has risen early to go to school. Later, he calls Margot\'s piano instructor, but is informed that Margot had canceled her lessons six months ago. David discovers that Margot had been pocketing the money for the lessons, before suddenly transferring $2,500 to a deleted Venmo account. Realizing that Margot is missing, David calls the police, and the case is assigned to Detective Rosemary Vick, who asks for information about Margot\'s personality and friendships. David manages to access Margot\'s Facebook and speaks to her contacts only to discover that Margot has not had close friends since Pamela\'s death.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-08 17:46:28','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::U/A\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C13',16),(296,'1675192','Take Shelter','Take Shelter','Take Shelter\r\nAtormentado\r\nСхоў\r\nO Abrigo\r\nU zaklon\r\nTake Shelter - Ein Sturm zieht auf\r\nTo katafygio\r\nΤο καταφύγιο\r\nSe\'arat ruhot\r\nテイク・シェルター\r\nSlėptuvė\r\nProcurem Abrigo\r\nУкрытие\r\nУ заклон\r\nZaklonisce\r\n歷劫重生\r\nSığınak\r\nУкриття\r\nХоватися',2011,120,7.3,98769,'English','United States','Drama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Jeff Nichols','Jeff Nichols','Tyler Davidson\r\nKevin Flanigan\r\nSarah Green\r\nBrian Kavanaugh-Jones\r\nChristos V.

Theirs is a close-knit Christian community. Samantha, a stay-at-home wife and mother which allows her to prioritize her time on Hannah, earns extra income by doing sewing for their neighbors and selling things she makes at craft fairs, they relying on Curtis\' job for a drilling company not only for its income but more importantly for its generous extended health benefits which in combination and still at great financial expense to them will allow them to get a cochlear implant for Hannah, the surgery scheduled for six weeks\' time. One night, Curtis has a nightmare, it of a massive storm producing a golden oily rain followed by an act of violence as a response to the storm. Each successive night he has versions of this same nightmare, always with a massive storm and its golden oily rain followed by a resulting act or threat of violence. During this time, he also notices unusual natural occurrences during his waking hours which only he seems to be experiencing, he unable to distinguish between reality and the nightmares when they are happening, he waking up in a cold sweat from the nightmares and being able to feel the effects of those violent acts in the nightmares for the remainder of the day. He doesn\'t tell Samantha of anything through which he is going. He tries to remove the perpetrators of those violent acts from his life, they more often than not friends and/or loved ones. He begins to think that he is suffering from mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, he having a family history of it, his mother Sarah who was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic twenty-five years ago and who still lives in assisted care. Regardless, he still can\'t help but believe that an apocalyptic storm of some sort will occur, his daytime visions and nightmares signs of it. As such, he begins to prepare for the storm, the largest and most expensive manifestation of his preparations being to shore up the existing storm cellar in their back yard. While Samantha had previously noticed Curtis\' unusual behavior and actions - he who was able to slough that behavior off as the manifestation of a proverbial cold - that behavior and those actions begin not only to alienate her but also all his friends and colleagues. But what if what Curtis is experiencing is not mental illness but truly a prediction of the apocalypse to come?\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-08 17:47:06','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R',16),(297,'2400463','The Invitation','Invitation','The Invitation\r\nFtesa\r\nO Convite\r\nПоканата\r\nΗ Πρόσκληση\r\nA meghívás\r\n不吉な招待状\r\nKvietimas\r\nZaproszenie\r\nПриглашение\r\nПозив\r\nLa invitación\r\n詭宴\r\nDavet\r\nЗапрошення',2015,100,6.6,103902,'English','United States','Drama\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Karyn Kusama','Phil Hay\r\nMatt Manfredi','Nate Bolotin\r\nDan Cogan\r\nAbigail Disney\r\nGeralyn White Dreyfous\r\nWendy Ettinger\r\nMartha Griffin\r\nPhil Hay\r\nBrian Kenney\r\nKathy Kenney\r\nLindsay Lanzillotta\r\nMynette Louie\r\nAnthony Mancilla\r\nMatt Manfredi\r\nJulie Parker Benello\r\nAubin Paul\r\nRegina K.

Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he\'s given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark\'s Humvee that he\'s riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony\'s technology for other matters.\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nAfter being kidnapped by a powerful terrorist organization, brilliant industrialist Tony Stark narrowly escapes using an iron suit he crafted from scrap metal and spare parts. Upon returning home, he devotes all of his time and resources to perfecting the iron man suit, and using it to fight evil, sometimes in the place where he least expects it.\r\n\r\nBillionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist? All this and more sums up Tony Stark. After a weapons presentation in Iraq, Stark gets himself captured which also results in him having a chest filled with shrapnel.

When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy\'s hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?\r\n-\r\nJawadjee\r\n\r\nThe events of Loki\'s attack on New York City has left Tony Stark a completely changed man. Now saddled with a severe case of insomnia and post traumatic stress disorder, Tony spends his sleepless nights the only way he knows how - coming up with new prototypes for the Iron Man suit. But now new events require that Tony suit up again. A villainous mad man known only as the Mandarin has staged a horrible attack on the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, and is coming for Tony. An angry Tony wants to confront the Mandarin face to face, who proceeds to stage an attack on Tony\'s Malibu mansion and leaves him with absolutely nothing - no Pepper, no toys except for a defunct Iron Man prototype called the MK42, and he\'s stranded in the middle of Tennessee. Tony believes the attack on the Chinese Theater and an attack on a small town in Tennessee are related. As he puts the pieces together and tries to get the MK42 working, he discovers far more sinister forces at work greater than the Mandarin himself. But how does an event from Tony\'s past fit in with the events of the present?\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nIn Malibu California, Tony Stark has insomnia and over 72 hours he develops the new prototype MK42 of the Iron Man armature. He also recalls events in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, when he had one night stand with the genetic scientist Maya Hansen that was researching a regenerative process and made fun of his fan Aldrich Killian on the New Year eve. There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin assumes the attempts broadcasting through television. When Tony\'s bodyguard and friend Happy Hogan is seriously wounded in an explosion, Tony Stark challenges Mandarin and gives his address to him. However, three helicopters attack his mansion and he loses everything but his prototype, and he awakes in the Tennessee. Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nAfter saving New York from an alien invasion, billionaire Tony Stark buries himself deeper into his work by building a ton of new and improved Iron Man suits. He also starts having constant nightmares and doesn\'t know why. But deep in the shadows, a new menace called the Mandarin starts orchestrating a series of terrorist attacks all over the world. When his home is demolished and his suits are destroyed, Stark begins a personal journey to finding out the truth about the bombings and tracking down whoever is truly responsible. Little does Stark know however is that someone else from his past has his own plans against him and proves to be even more powerful than Stark realizes.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346\r\n\r\nTony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wrestles with inner demons while contending with monsters of his own creation in this sequel from writerdirector Shane Black. The story in Iron Man 3 picks up shortly after the events of The Avengers. Having previously entered another dimension in order to save New York City, Tony remains deeply haunted by the experience. Unable to sleep, he throws himself into his work with such intensity that it begins to take a heavy toll on both his mental health and his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Tony has only started to appreciate the gravity of his problems when an enigmatic terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) hijacks the airwaves and threatens to bring America to its knees with a painful series of \"lessons\" that even President Ellis (William Sadler) won\'t be able to ignore. When Tony\'s former security guard Happy Hogan (Favreau) is badly injured in an explosion caused by one of the Mandarin\'s agents, the vengeful playboy issues a public threat that results in his home being completely destroyed in a devastating attack, leaving him to face his enemy with only one badly damaged prototype suit. Fortunately, Tony isn\'t on his own, and with the help of Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins), he pieces together the mystery of the Mandarin, whose final \"lesson\" promises to be the most painful of all..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-08','','2020-05-14 04:22:14','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nColombia::7\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::12\r\nVietnam::C13',12),(306,'0441773','Kung Fu Panda','Kung Fu Panda','Kung Fu Panda\r\nКунг-Фу Панда\r\nGongfu xiongmao\r\nKungfu panda\r\nKung fu panda\r\nΚουνγκ Φου Πάντα\r\nPanday-e Kung Fu-kar\r\nカンフー・パンダ\r\nO Panda do Kung Fu\r\nКунг-фу Панда\r\n功夫熊貓\r\nПанда Кунг-фу\r\nKung Fu Panda: The IMAX Experience\r\nKung-fu Panda',2008,92,7.6,448524,'English','United States','Animation\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nComedy\r\nFamily\r\nFantasy','Mark Osborne\r\nJohn Stevenson','Jonathan Aibel\r\nGlenn Berger\r\nEthan Reiff\r\nCyrus Voris\r\nChris Poche','Jonathan Aibel\r\nGlenn Berger\r\nMelissa Cobb\r\nBill Damaschke\r\nLorne Orleans\r\nKristina Reed','John Powell\r\nHans Zimmer','Jack Black\r\nDustin Hoffman\r\nAngelina Jolie\r\nIan McShane\r\nJackie Chan\r\nSeth Rogen\r\nLucy Liu\r\nDavid Cross\r\nRandall Duk Kim\r\nJames Hong\r\nDan Fogler\r\nMichael Clarke Duncan\r\nWayne Knight\r\nKyle Gass\r\nJR Reed\r\nLaura Kightlinger\r\nTanya Haden\r\nStephen Kearin\r\nMark Osborne\r\nJohn Stevenson\r\nJeremy Shipp\r\nMelissa Cobb\r\nKent Osborne\r\nEmily Burns\r\nStephanie Harvey\r\nRiley Osborne\r\nKresimir Mikic','Prepare for awesomeness.\r\n\r\nExperience the pandamonium in IMAX\r\n\r\nSummertime is Pandatime.\r\n\r\nHe\'s not a big fat panda... he\'s THE big fat panda!','To everyone\'s surprise, including his own, Po, an overweight, clumsy panda, is chosen as protector of the Valley of Peace.

That man is The Exorcist.\r\n\r\nThe Devil Inside\r\n\r\nThe Scariest Movie Of All Time Has Returned.

Meanwhile, a young priest at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother\'s terminal sickness. And, book-ending the story, a frail, elderly priest recognizes the necessity for a show-down with an old demonic enemy.\r\n-\r\nAndrew Harmon\r\n\r\nSeparated from her actor husband, Hollywood actress Chris MacNeil and her preteen daughter Regan are in Washington DC, where Chris is on an extended location shoot for a movie called \"Crash Course\". They have rented a brownstone in Georgetown as a place to live during the shoot, after which Chris plans to take Regan to Europe until their new house in Los Angeles is constructed. Chris continually hears noises in the middle of the night emanating from the attic, which she assumes is nothing more than a small infestation of rats. Concurrently, Regan, who had been an even keeled child, is showing periodic signs of unusual behavior, such as hyperactivity, swearing, lying and lack of concentration. The GP, Dr. Klein, who can only surmise the symptoms are a manifestation of stress from the separation and temporary move to DC away from her home, diagnoses her condition, solely based on the symptoms, as hyperkinesia. Despite Dr. Klein and other physicians trying to determine and explain Regan\'s increasingly abnormal and bizarre behavior with scientific theories, Chris begins to believe that there is more at play, especially as Regan\'s behavior ultimately includes violence and acts of superhuman strength, which can only be classified as other worldly which Regan herself could not have directly caused on her own, such as the rat-less noises in the attic. Despite having no religious convictions, Chris is convinced that since there is some other worldly force overtaking Regan, a course of action is to have that force - the demon - exorcised from Regan\'s being. Who contacts her is Father Damien Karras - also an M.D. who acts as a psychiatric counselor for the Catholic church - who Chris for whatever reason had been drawn to as a person she has seen in the neighborhood. Father Karras is facing his own crisis of faith upon the recent death of his mother. He needs not only the permission of the church to proceed but also his own faith that whatever he does will help as opposed to hurt Regan. Who the church also sends is Father Lankester Merrin, who may have a better understanding of what has possessed Regan and why it has chosen her, which is necessary to be able to combat it. The questions become whether Fathers Merrin and Karras have a strong enough faith to exorcise the demon and what they are willing to do to achieve their mission.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nMore and more, Regan, the otherwise happy twelve-year-old daughter of the successful actress, Chris MacNeil, is showing signs of erratic and disturbing behaviour, after an ill-advised contact with the supernatural. As a result, as the situation is rapidly getting out of hand, with perfectly healthy Regan becoming increasingly violent and obscene, desperate Chris is willing to do everything in her power to keep her child safe, including seeking spiritual help. Now, Chris\' only hope rests on the inexperienced Greek-American Catholic priest, Father Damien Karras, and the weary exorcist, Father Lankester Merrin, to perform the intricate purification rite that will rid Regan of the malevolent spirit that is tormenting her. But, can they confront the embodiment of evil?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nAccompanied by her 12 year-old daughter Regan, actress Chris McNeil relocates to Washington D.C. where she is filming a movie. Mother and daughter have a good relationship but after a time Regan begins to act strangely. She undergoes various neurological tests but doctors can find nothing to explain her behavior. As Regan\'s situation reaches crisis proportions - she has to be tied to her bed, swears like a sailor and speaks in tongues - Chris turns to Father Karras, a Roman Catholic priest and psychiatrist to see if an exorcism might be the solution to their problem. Karras is incredulous but the church eventually agrees calling in Father Merrin, who has previously conducted an exorcism and come face to face with the devil.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nA movie actress taking up temporary residence in Washington D.C. has her troubles. The script for the movie she\'s filming seems inadequate. Her ex, who is also the father of her adolescent daughter, Regan, neglects to call the girl on her birthday. And the attic has rats. Meanwhile, Father Karras, a priest and a psychiatrist, is losing his faith; and he\'s dealing with a sick mother who needs medical care he hasn\'t the money to provide. Another priest, the old and ailing Father Merrin, has just returned from Iraq with forebodings of evil. These three persons meet when the sweet and cheerful Regan turns foul-mouthed and violent. But her sickness is beyond the reach of a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. What Regan needs is an exorcist.\r\n-\r\nJ.

Advancements in technology and science have allowed the evolution of millions of worlds that are otherwise in many respects still primitive. These worlds are somewhat loosely allied into a galactic Republic, whose capital world is the planet Coruscant, a planetary city. Upholding order for the Republic are the Jedi, an order of warriors endowed with near-super power derived from self-generated fields of energy known collectively as the Force. Within the Republic, dissident worlds have banded into an alliance known as the Trade Federation, and the Trade Federation is locked in a dispute with the peaceful world of Naboo. Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his youthful apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, have been sent to Naboo to help mediate an end to the dispute, but Nute Gunray, an alien viceroy, orders them to be killed, and the two Jedi discover upon their escape that the Trade Federation will launch an invasion of Naboo. With the help of a well-meaning but hopelessly subliterate alien native of Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Naboo to rescue her ruler, Queen Amidala, a ruler whose rule is a mixture of monarchy and republican democracy. Escaping Naboo, they are attacked by a Federation baseship and are forced to land on the distant planet Tatooine, where in seeking parts to complete their journey to Coruscant they encounter a young boy, Anakin Skywalker, a slave who possesses a gift for the savagely dangerous sport of podracing - a gift that Qui-Gon deduces is part of a genetic makeup perfect for the Jedi Order. Anakin eventually joins with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and in the process attracts the attention of one of Queen Amidala\'s handmaidens with a dramatic secret, and all reach Coruscant, but endless and pointless debate within the Republic\'s Senate leave them no choice but to strike out on their own to liberate Naboo, a task made all the more difficult because a traitor within Coruscant has at his command a dissident Jedi warrior who seeks the death of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.\r\n-\r\nstp43','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-14 04:56:12','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nBulgaria::B\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::LH\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::10\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::G',12),(310,'0121765','Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones','Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones','Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\r\nStar Wars: Episodio II - El ataque de los clones\r\nStar Wars: Episode II\r\nStar Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger\r\nStar Wars, Episódio II: Ataque dos Clones\r\nМеждузвездни войни: Епизод II - Клонираните атакуват\r\nStar wars: Episode II - L\'attaque des clones\r\nStar Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones\r\n星球大战前传2：克隆人的进攻\r\nRatovi zvijezda: Epizoda II - Klonovi napadaju\r\nStar Wars II: Klony útočí\r\nStar Wars: Episode II - Klonernes angreb\r\nStar wars: Osa II - Kloonide rünnak\r\nStar wars episodi II - klonerna anfaller\r\nStar Wars II: Kloonien hyökkäys\r\nStar Wars: Episodi II - Kloonien hyökkäys\r\nStar Wars II - Kloonien hyökkäys\r\nStar Wars : Épisode II - L\'Attaque des clones\r\nStar Wars: Epeisodio II - I epithesi ton klonon\r\nStar Wars: Επεισόδιο 2 - Η επίθεση των κλώνων\r\nΟ πόλεμος των άστρων: επεισόδιο 2 - η επίθεση των κλώνωνa\r\nStar Wars II. rész - A klónok támadása\r\nStar Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Hammocks\r\nJange Setaregan: Ghesmate 2 - Hamleye Cloneha\r\nStar Wars: Episodio II - L\'attacco dei cloni\r\nSutâ wôzu episoddo 2: Kurôn no kôgeki\r\nスター・ウォーズ　エピソード2 クローンの攻撃\r\nЖұлдызды соғыстар: Эпизод II - Клондар шабуылы\r\nZvaigžņu kaŗi: Episode II - Klonu uzbrukums\r\nŽvaigždžių karai.

Upon arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other, and he has nightmarish visions of his mother. They travel to his home planet, Tatooine, to see his mother, and he discovers that she has been abducted by Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying, and he kills all the Tusken tribe, including the women and children. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he discovers who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmits his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi-Wan\'s message? And will the secret love between Anakin and Amidala succeed?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nTen years after the \'Phantom Menace\' threatened the planet Naboo, Padmé Amidala is now a Senator representing her homeworld. A faction of political separatists, led by Count Dooku, attempts to assassinate her. There are not enough Jedi to defend the Republic against the threat, so Chancellor Palpatine enlists the aid of Jango Fett, who promises that his army of clones will handle the situation. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi continues to train the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who fears that the Jedi code will forbid his growing romance with Amidala.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nJedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker discover there is more than meets the eye behind an assassination attempt on Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala\'s life. Meanwhile, a Sith Lord orchestrates events between the forces of good and evil, all the while waiting to play the final move that will ensure him control of the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nDoug Funnie\r\n\r\nSet ten years after the events in \"The Phantom Menace\". After an assassination attempt on the life of Senator Padmé Amidala, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan learner Anakin Skywalker are sent to investigate. After tracking down the assassin, she is killed before any information can be driven out of her. The two Jedi are then sent on two different missions: Anakin is sent to Naboo with Padmé and Obi-Wan is sent to the planet of Kamino where he will investigate the assassination attempts. Little does he know, he is investigating some of the biggest events of the Star Wars saga, as he finds out that there is a connection between the assassination attempts and a separatist movement led by a former Jedi against the Republic. The Galactic Republic finds itself at the brink of a civil war.\r\n-\r\nChris Bierman\r\n\r\nAs now-Senator Padmé Amidala returns to Coruscant to vote on an important Senatorial matter, an assassination attempt on her life prompts the Jedi Council to send Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker to protect her and find out who the assassin is. As this is happening, a rogue Jedi named Count Dooku leads separatists on Geonosis to rebel against the Senate. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine moves for a vote for a Republic Army to protect the Republic, as there has not been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic. As Obi-Wan\'s investigations lead him to Kamino, he finds a massive clone army being produced, with a bounty hunter - the last of the Mandalorians - named Jango Fett as the master clone. As he chases the elusive bounty hunter, Jango (and his cloned son Boba) leads Obi Wan to Geonosis, where he meets Count Dooku and finds a startling revelation about the former Jedi. As Anakin is left behind to protect Padmé, his feelings for her grow into something more than friendship. From Naboo to Tatooine, it grows into love for her. But when a tragedy strikes Anakin\'s life, he begins slipping away from the Light Side of the Force, and perhaps from the Force itself.\r\n-\r\nErik P','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-14 04:56:45','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::LH\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(311,'0121766','Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith','Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith','Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\r\nStar Wars: Episodio III - La venganza de los Sith\r\nStar Wars: Episode III - Die Rache der Sith\r\nStar wars: Episode III - La revanche des sith\r\nStar Wars, Episódio III: A Vingança dos Sith\r\nМеждузвездни войни: Епизод III - Отмъщението на Ситите\r\nStar Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith\r\n星球大战前传3：西斯的复仇\r\nRatovi zvijezda: Epizoda III - Osveta sitha\r\nStar Wars: Pomsta Sithu\r\nStar Wars III: Pomsta Sithů\r\nStar Wars: Episode III - Sith-fyrsternes hævn\r\nStar wars: Osa III - Sithi kättemaks\r\nStar Wars: Episodi III - Sithin kosto\r\nStar Wars: Episod III - Mörkrets hämnd\r\nStar Wars: Sithin kosto\r\nStar Wars : Épisode III - La Revanche des Sith\r\nStar Wars: Επεισόδιο 3 - Η εκδίκηση των Σιθ\r\nStar Wars: Epeisodio III - I ekdikisi ton Sith\r\nStar Wars III: I ekdikisi ton Sith\r\nΟ πόλεμος των άστρων: επεισόδιο 3 - η εκδίκηση των Σιθ\r\nΟ πόλεμος των άστρων: Επεισόδιο 3 - Η εκδίκηση των Σιθ\r\nStar Wars III. rész - A Sith-ek bosszúja\r\nMilhemet ha\'kohavim, perek III: nikmat ha\'Sith\r\nStar Wars: Episodio III - La vendetta dei Sith\r\nSutâ wôzu episoddo 3 - Shisu no fukushû\r\nスター・ウォーズ　エピソード3 シスの復讐\r\nスター・ウォーズ エピソード3/シスの復讐\r\nЖұлдызды соғыстар: Эпизод III - Ситхтер кегі\r\nZvaigžņu kaŗi: III Daļa.

As Obi-Wan pursues a new threat, Anakin acts as a double agent between the Jedi Council and Palpatine and is lured into a sinister plan to rule the galaxy.\r\n\r\nNearly three years have passed since the beginning of the Clone Wars. The Republic, with the help of the Jedi, take on Count Dooku and the Separatists. With a new threat rising, the Jedi Council sends Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to aid the captured Chancellor. Anakin feels he is ready to be promoted to Jedi Master. Obi-Wan is hunting down the Separatist General, Grievous. When Anakin has future visions of pain and suffering coming Padmé\'s way, he sees Master Yoda for counsel. When Darth Sidious executes Order 66, it destroys most of all the Jedi have built. Experience the birth of Darth Vader. Feel the betrayal that leads to hatred between two brothers. And witness the power of hope.\r\n\r\nThe Jedi Order is on the brink of collapse and Anakin Skywalker no longer believes in the wisdom of his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. As The Force calls him to decide Padme\'s fate, Anakin will desperately explore every possibility to save his wife from imminent death in childbirth.\r\n-\r\nJohnny\r\n\r\nAnakin now a skilled Jedi Knight, turns against his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi and becomes Darth Vader.

The commander of the Droid Army, General Grievous, kidnaps Chancellor Palpatine. The Jedi send Anakin and Obi-Wan to rescue the Chancellor and put an end to the Separatists wrath on the galaxy. But with an unfortunate turn of events, things don\'t turn out the way they\'d envisioned...\r\n\r\nAnakin\'s wife Padmé is pregnant, but he is having visions of her dying in childbirth. Meanwhile, a Sith Lord is manipulating the Council, Obi-Wan is chasing the robotic separatist leader General Grievous, and Yoda helps the Wookiees defend themselves against the droid armies on Kashyyyk.

Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo R2-D2 and C-3PO to rescue the beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance and restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nPart IV in George Lucas\' epic, this movie opens with a rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire\'s most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star.\r\n-\r\nP. Wong\r\n\r\nLuke Skywalker stays with his aunt and uncle on a farm on Tatooine. He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable \"Death Star\" capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers\' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-wan. Will Luke, Obi-wan, and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever?\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nPrincess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful Princess Leia and restore justice in the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch\r\n\r\nIn a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as light-sabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan, but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy.\r\n-\r\nMichael Daly','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-14 05:03:23','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::12\r\nBulgaria::B\r\nCanada::PG\r\nCzechia::U\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG',0),(314,'0080684','Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back','Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back','Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\r\nEl imperio contraataca\r\nStar Wars: Episodio V - El imperio contraataca\r\nDe tegenaanval van het rijk\r\nStar Wars, Episódio V: O Império Contra-Ataca\r\nO Império Contra-Ataca\r\nGuerra nas Estrelas 2 - O Império Contra-Ataca\r\nМеждузвездни войни: Епизод V - Империята отвръща на удара\r\nL\'Empire contre-attaque\r\nLa guerrre des étoiles V: L\'empire contre-attaque\r\n星球大战2：帝国反击战\r\nRatovi zvijezda V: Imperij uzvraća udarac\r\nStar Wars V: Impérium vrací úder\r\nHviezdne vojny V: Impérium vracia úder\r\nHvězdné války V: Impérium vrací úder\r\nImperiet slår igen\r\nStar wars: Osa V - Impeeriumi vastulöök\r\nTähtede sõda: Impeeriumi vastulöök\r\nImperiumin vastaisku\r\nStar Wars: Imperiumin vastaisku\r\nRymdimperiet slår tillbaka\r\nStar Wars: Episodi V - Imperiumin vastaisku\r\nStar Wars: Épisode V - L\'Empire contre-attaque\r\nStar Wars: Episode V - Das Imperium schlägt zurück\r\nΗ αυτοκρατορία αντεπιτίθεται\r\nΟ πόλεμος των άστρων: Επεισόδιο 5 - Η αυτοκρατορία αντεπιτίθεται\r\nA Birodalom visszavág\r\nJang-e Setaregan: Emprator Zarbeh Mizanad\r\nHa-Emperia Maka Shenit\r\nStar Wars V - L\'Impero colpisce ancora\r\nStar Wars: Episodio V - L\'Impero colpisce ancora\r\nL\'Impero colpisce ancora\r\nGuerre stellari - L\'Impero colpisce ancora\r\nSutâ wôzu episoddo 5: Teikoku no gyakushû\r\nスター・ウォーズ　帝国の逆襲\r\nStar Wars: Empire Strikes Back\r\nЖұлдызды соғыстар: Эпизод V - Империяның кері соққысы\r\nŽvaigždžių karai.

But even on such an icy, backwater world, they cannot escape the evil Darth Vader\'s eyes for long, and he devastates the Rebel base in an assault with the Imperial AT-AT walkers. Luke flees to Dagobah to begin Jedi training with Master Yoda, while Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, and C-3PO run the blockade of Imperial Star Destroyers in the Millennium Falcon. The Imperials pursue them across the galaxy and eventually catch up with them on Bespin. Now Darth Vader plans to use them as bait to lure Luke Skywalker to him, and turns Han Solo over to Boba Fett as a prize to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke learns a terrible family secret after losing a swordfight with the Dark Lord. Will he, and the others, escape the Empire\'s clutches?\r\n-\r\nmedic249a2','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-14 05:03:54','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::12\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nWest Germany::12',0),(315,'0086190','Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi','Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi','Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\r\nEl regreso del Jedi\r\nLa Guerra de las Galaxias: El Regreso del Jedi\r\nO Retorno de Jedi\r\nStar Wars, Episódio VI: O Retorno do Jedi\r\nМеждузвездни войни: Епизод VI - Завръщането на джедаите\r\nLe Retour du Jedi\r\nLa guerre des étoiles VI: Le retour du jedi\r\n星球大战3：绝地归来\r\nEl retorno del Jedi\r\nRatovi zvijezda VI: Povratak Jedija\r\nStar Wars VI: Návrat Jediů\r\nHvězdné války VI: Návrat Jediho\r\nHviezdne vojny VI: Návrat Jediho\r\nJedi-ridderen vender tilbage\r\nStar wars: Osa VI - Jedi tagasitulek\r\nJedin paluu\r\nStar wars episodi VI - jedin paluu\r\nJedis återkomst\r\nStar wars VI - jedin paluu\r\nStar Wars: Episode VI - Die Rückkehr der Jedi-Ritter\r\nI epistrofi ton Jedi\r\nΗ επιστροφή των Τζεντάι\r\nO polemos ton astron: I epistrofi ton Jedi\r\nΟ πόλεμος των άστρων: Επεισόδιο 6 - Η επιστροφή των Τζεντάι\r\nA Jedi visszatér\r\nCsillagok háborúja VI. rész - A Jedi visszatér\r\nStar Wars VI. - A Jedi visszatér\r\nJang-e Setaregan: Bazgasht-e Jedi\r\nIl ritorno dello Jedi\r\nGuerre stellari - Il ritorno dello Jedi\r\nStar Wars VI - Il ritorno dello Jedi\r\nStar Wars: Episodio VI - Il ritorno dello Jedi\r\nSutâ wôzu/Jedai no fukushuu\r\nSutâ wôzu/Jedai no fukushuu Tokubetsuhen\r\nスター・ウォーズ　ジェダイの復讐\r\nStar Wars: Jedi\'s Revenge\r\nЖұлдызды соғыстар: Эпизод VI - Джедайдың оралуы С\r\nŽvaigždžių karai.

Meanwhile, Luke struggles to help Darth Vader back from the dark side without falling into the Emperor\'s trap.\r\n\r\nLuke Skywalker battles Jabba the Hutt and Darth Vader to save his comrades in the Rebel Alliance and triumph over the Galactic Empire. Han Solo and Princess Leia reaffirm their love, and team with Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, the Ewoks, and droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to aid in the disruption of the Dark Side, and the defeat of the evil emperor.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nEmperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and the Empire are building a new Death Star. Meanwhile, Han Solo has been imprisoned, and Luke Skywalker has sent R2-D2 and C-3PO to try and free him. Princess Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, and Chewbacca go along as well. The final battle takes place on the Forest Moon of Endor, with its natural inhabitants, the Ewoks, lending a hand to the rebels.\r\n-\r\nColin Tinto\r\n\r\nAs the evil Emperor Palpatine oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, smuggler Han Solo is rescued from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt by his friends, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, and Chewbacca. Leaving Luke Skywalker Jedi training with Master Yoda, Solo returns to the Rebel fleet to prepare to complete his battle with the Empire. During the ensuing fighting, the newly returned Luke Skywalker is captured by Darth Vader.\r\n-\r\nJames Pearce\r\n\r\nLight-sabers sparkle, the Millennium Falcon flashes through hyperspace, and creatures from all over the galaxy defy the Galactic Empire, in this stunning third chapter of the \"Star Wars\" saga. As the Rebels prepare to attack Emperor Palpatine\'s awesome new Death Star, Han Solo remains imprisoned by the loathsome outlaw Jabba the Hutt, who has also captured Princess Leia. Luke Skywalker rescues his friends, but he will not be a true Jedi Knight until he confronts Darth Vader again, who has sworn to win him over to the Dark Side of the Force. With old favorites like Chewbacca, Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian, plus the small, but stalwart Ewoks.\r\n-\r\nRobert Lynch\r\n\r\nThe Empire is more than halfway through construction of a new Death Star, almost twice as big, but more than twice as powerful. When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker and the rebels. Han Solo is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia soon finds herself in the gangster\'s hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba\'s palace, hoping to secure his friends\' freedom. But Jabba has no intention of doing so, and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian is pressed into action to lead the rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. However, Luke Skywalker surrenders to Darth Vader\'s soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader\'s Master, Emperor Palpatine, on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire\'s triumph, unless things start to change quickly.\r\n-\r\nmedic249a2','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-14 05:05:25','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::NRC\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::13+\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::11\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUkraine::ZA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::G\r\nWest Germany::12',12),(316,'2488496','Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens','Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens','Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\r\nStar Wars: El despertar de la fuerza\r\nStar Wars VII - Das Erwachen der Macht\r\nStar Wars: El Despertar de la Fuerza\r\nStar Wars: O Despertar da Força\r\nМеждузвездни войни: Силата се пробужда\r\nLa guerre des étoiles VII - Le réveil de la force\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens\r\nStar Wars: Episodio VII\r\n星球大战7：原力觉醒\r\nRatovi zvijezda: Sila se budi\r\nHvězdné války VII: Síla se probouzí\r\nStar Wars: Síla se probouzí\r\nStar Wars: Jõud tärkab\r\nTähtien Sota: Episodi 7\r\nStar Wars: Le Réveil de la Force\r\nStar Wars : Épisode VII - Le Réveil de la Force\r\nStar Wars: Das Erwachen der Macht\r\nStar Wars - Episode VII: Das Erwachen der Macht\r\nStar Wars: Η δύναμη ξυπνάει\r\nΟ Πόλεμος των Άστρων: Επεισόδιο 7 - Η Δύναμη Ξυπνά\r\nStar Wars: Az ébredő Erő\r\nMilhemet ha\'kohavim: ha\'ko\'ah mit\'orer\r\nStar Wars - Il risveglio della Forza\r\nStar Wars: Episodio VII - Il risveglio della Forza\r\nSutâ wôzu: Fôsu no kakusei\r\nStar Wars: Awakening of Force\r\nスター・ウォーズ　フォースの覚醒\r\nЖұлдызды соғыстар: Күштің оянуы\r\nЖұлдызды соғыстар: Эпизод VI - Күштің оянуы\r\nZvaigžņu kari: Spēks mostas\r\nŽvaigždžiu karai: galia nubunda\r\nStar Wars: Episode VII - Le réveil de la Force\r\nStar Wars: Episodio VII - El despertar de la fuerza\r\nGwiezdne wojny: Przebudzenie Mocy\r\nGwiezdne wojny: Część VII - Przebudzenie Mocy\r\nStar Wars: Episódio VII - O Despertar da Força\r\nВојна на ѕвездите: Силата се буди\r\nRăzboiul stelelor - Episodul VII: Trezirea Forţei\r\nЗвёздные войны: Пробуждение Силы\r\nЗвездани ратови: Епизода VII - Буђење силе\r\nРатови звезда: Епизода VII - Буђење силе\r\nHviezdne vojny VII: Sila sa prebúdza\r\nVojna zvezd: Sila se prebuja\r\nStar Wars: El despertar de la Fuerza\r\nStar Wars: El despertar de la força\r\nStar Wars: Episodio VII - El despertar de la Fuerza\r\nSTAR WARS：原力覺醒\r\nYıldız Savaşları VII: Güç Uyanıyor\r\nYıldız Savaşları Bölüm 7: Güç Uyanıyor\r\nyıldız Savaşları: Bölüm VII - Güç Uyanıyor\r\nЗоряні війни: Епізод 7 - Пробудження сили\r\nChiến Tranh Giữa Các Vì Sao Tập 7: Thần Lực Thức Tỉnh\r\nStar Wars: Episode VII\r\nStar Wars: Episode 7 - The Force Awakens',2015,138,7.8,899430,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','J.J.

Rey, as well as a rogue stormtrooper and two smugglers, are thrown into the middle of a battle between the Resistance and the daunting legions of the First Order.\r\n-\r\nNoah White\r\n\r\nA scavenger (Daisy Ridley) and a renegade stormtrooper (John Boyega) enlist the help of legendary smugglers/freedom fighters Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to transport a droid carrying information regarding the whereabouts of long lost Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to General Leia Organa of the Resistance before it falls into the hands of Kylo Ren and the First Order.\r\n\r\nWhen critical information is placed into a simple droid, both the evil First Order and the heroic Resistance go searching for it. Then something neither of them planned for happens: Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku finds the droid and keeps it as her own. Finn, an ex-stormtrooper who hopes to leave his past behind him, crosses paths with her and breaks the news of what exactly the importance of the droid is. Next thing either of them know is that they are on the run in order to withhold the droid from the First Order. They meet a pair of old buddies and after a few skirmishes between them and the determined First Order, the droid is brought to the Resistance base. There, multiple plans are hatched against the First Order while the secret information on the droid is slowly and surely working itself out...\r\n\r\n30 years ago the Empire was defeated and now a new threat, the First Order has risen from the ashes of the Empire. A scavenger called Rey has come into contact with a droid that contains a map to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who has vanished. Rey and a rogue stormtrooper called Finn find themselves in a monumental conflict between good and evil, that will see faces old and new.\r\n\r\nThirty years after the Galactic Empire vanquished, a new threat rises. The First Order attempt to rule the Galaxy and only a small bunch of heroes have the ability to stop them. Meanwhile, a female scavenger named Rey teams up with a rogue stormtroopter to return a droid to the resistance base containing a map to a legendary Jedi Master.\r\n\r\nThe Empire is no more. In its place, The First Order has risen from the ashes of Darth Vader\'s legacy and aims to consolidate its power across the galaxy. However, The First Order is trying to find Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, and wipe him off the face of galaxy.

Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss\' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12\'s female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives.\r\n-\r\nSuzanne Collins\r\n\r\nSet in a future North America known as \"Panem\", the Capitol selects a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve outlying districts to compete in the annual \"Hunger Games\", a televised fight-to-the-death. The film is centered around Katniss Everdeen - a 16-year-old girl from District 12, who volunteers for her 12-year-old sister, Prim, when Prim\'s name is chosen - and Katniss\'s fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta Mellark, with whom she has some rather dramatic history. Katniss is then rushed to the Capitol, where she undergoes intense training before being thrust into the arena to fight to become the victor of the seventy-fourth annual Hunger Games.\r\n-\r\nfallgeek\r\n\r\nIn order to control future rebellions by remembering the past rebellion, the Powers That Be of the dystopian society of Panem force two youngsters from each of the twelve districts to participate in The Hunger Games. The rules are very simple: the twenty-four players must kill each other and survive in the wilderness until only one remains. The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population. In District 12, teenager Katniss Everdeen is a great hunter and archer. When her younger sister, Primrose Everdeen, is selected as one of the \"tributes\" of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark, they head by train to the Capital to be prepared for the brutal game.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-16 05:32:35','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::(Banned)',12),(322,'1034314','Iron Sky','Iron Sky','Iron Sky\r\nDeu a Louca nos Nazis\r\nЖелязно небе\r\nSoleil noir\r\nŽeljezno nebo\r\nRautataivas\r\nIron Sky - Wir kommen in Frieden\r\nIron Sky: To 4o Reich antepitithetai\r\nIron Sky: Το Τέταρτο Ράιχ Αντεπιτίθεται\r\nIron Sky: Támad a Hold\r\nIron Sky - Saranno nazi vostri\r\nアイアン・スカイ\r\nDzelzs debesis\r\nGelezinis dangus\r\nNazis Invasores\r\nIron Sky.

Washington claims the mission is just a publicity stunt for the President of the United States, but what else could the man be but a scout for the imminent attack by Earth forces? The Fourth Reich must act. Two Nazi officers, ruthless Klaus Adler and idealistic Renate Richter, travel to Earth to prepare the invasion.

However, in humankind\'s unlikely last refuge--the ruined swastika lunar base--overpopulation, famine, and limited food resources put in jeopardy the survival of both races, until the feisty daughter of James Washington and Renate Richter, Obi, decides to give humanity a fighting chance. Now, equipped with an indecipherable ancient map, Obi and a motley crew of earthlings embark on a dangerous mission to the centre of the fabled Hollow Earth, to find a source of unlimited power; nevertheless, the Vril, an alien shape-shifting race of reptilians, want it all for themselves.

He also happens to be suffering from a strange condition similar to schizophrenia which he futilely tries to keep under control by regularly taking both legal and illegal drugs and visiting his therapist. When a strange feisty young woman named Darlene and a secretive middle-aged man calling himself Mr. Robot, who claims to be the mysterious leader of an underground hacking group known as F-Society, offer Elliot a chance to take his vigilantism to the next level and help them take down E-Corp, the corrupt multi-national financial company that Elliot works for and likes to call Evil Corp, Elliot finds himself at the crossroads. Mr. Robot, who has personal reasons for wanting to take down E-Corp, also reveals that he already has one ally, an even more mysterious, secretive and highly dangerous shadowy hacking group known only as Dark Army. Meanwhile, Elliot\'s childhood and only friend, Angela, who blames E-Corp for the death of their parents, tries to take down E-Corp legally by joining their ranks and trying to dig up evidence of their corruption from the inside. A wild card in this scheme becomes Tyrell Wellick, an unhinged psychopathic E-Corp yuppie, originally from Scandinavia, who has a very unusual relationship with his dominant and ambitious wife Joanna. After many twists and turns, Mr. Robot\'s plan is finally put in motion - with catastrophic (un)intended results. But that\'s just the end of the beginning of the real story.\r\n\r\nMr. Robot follows Elliot, a young programmer who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and as a vigilante hacker by night. Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious leader of an underground hacker group recruits him to destroy the firm he is paid to protect. Compelled by his personal beliefs, Elliot struggles to resist the chance to take down the multinational CEOs he believes are running (and ruining) the world. Eventually, he realizes that a global conspiracy does exist, but not the one he expected.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nYoung, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot\'s task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running -- and ruining -- the world.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nIn the year 2015, an incredibly unstable cyber-security engineer named Elliot is recruited by a shady group of hackers to bring down the most powerful corporation in the history of civilization; meanwhile, a dark project whose purpose could bring about profound implications for society itself nears its completion.\r\n-\r\nchingeeflingee','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-23 17:15:20','','','','','',1,4,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::18\r\nIndia::16+\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::BA\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::18+\r\nPoland::18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::TV-MA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16',16),(325,'0167404','The Sixth Sense','Sixth Sense','The Sixth Sense\r\nSexto sentido\r\nO Sexto Sentido\r\nШесто чувство\r\nLe sixième sens\r\nEl sexto sentido\r\n第六感\r\nEl Sexto Sentido\r\nŠesto čulo\r\nŠestý smysl\r\nDen sjette sans\r\nKuues meel\r\nDet sjätte sinnet\r\nKuudes aisti\r\nSjätte sinnet\r\nKuudes Aisti\r\nSixième sens\r\nMeekvse Grdznoba\r\nSixth Sense\r\nThe Sixth Sense - Nicht jede Gabe ist ein Segen\r\nΗ έκτη αίσθηση\r\nI ekti aisthisi\r\n鬼眼\r\nHatodik érzék\r\nद सिक्थ सेन्स\r\nHesse sheshom\r\nThe Sixth Sense - Il sesto senso\r\nIl sesto senso\r\nShikkusu sensu\r\nシックス・センス\r\nŠeštasis pojūtis\r\nDen sjette sansen\r\nSzósty zmysł\r\nAl șaselea simț\r\nШестое чувство\r\nШесто чуло\r\nŠiesty zmysel\r\nŠesti čut\r\nEl sisè sentit\r\n靈異第六感\r\nAltıncı his\r\nШосте чуття\r\nOltinchi hissiyot\r\nGiác Quan Thứ Sáu',1999,107,8.1,957943,'English\r\nLatin\r\nSpanish','United States','Drama\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','M.

After this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with the same ills as the ex-patient (Donnie Wahlberg) . This boy \"sees dead people\". Crowe spends a lot of time with the boy much to the dismay of his wife (Olivia Williams). Cole\'s mom (Toni Collette) is at her wit\'s end with what to do about her son\'s increasing problems. Crowe is the boy\'s only hope.\r\n-\r\nJeff Mellinger\r\n\r\nTo wipe the slate clean and get a chance to redeem himself after that soul-scarring incident one year ago, the Philadelphia child psychologist, Dr Malcolm Crowe, decides to take on his first new case--the profoundly troubled eight-year-old boy, Cole Sear. Exhibiting the same symptoms like one of his former patients, Cole goes one step further by solemnly claiming he has the gift, or curse, of a rare and unwelcome sixth sense; the mysterious ability to see the dreadful and unquiet spectres of the deceased who linger in this earth. However, can a slowly-recovering sceptic believe, let alone, heal, a desperate soul crying for help? And, what if Cole\'s disturbingly recurring apparitions are not figments of an injured fantasy, but an irrefutable reality?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nChild psychologist Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis)is one night visited by an ex-patient named Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) who is not just angry, but enraged. He wounds Crowe, then kills himself. A few months later Crowe is visited by a 9-year old boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment). He sees dead people who do not know they are dead. Because of this, he is called a freak in school. Crowe, at first thinks he is seeing things, but after spending a lot of time with Cole (much to his wife\'s (Olivia Williams) dismay), he discovers Cole may be seeing dead people after all.\r\n-\r\nneo101\r\n\r\nChild psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg) who he failed to help. After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can\'t stop thinking about it.

Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don\'t know they\'re dead.\r\n-\r\nrmlohner','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-05-31 02:15:03','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16/13\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::12A\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::TV-PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',18),(326,'1219827','Ghost in the Shell','Ghost in the Shell','Ghost in the Shell\r\nLa vigilante del futuro: Ghost in the Shell\r\nDuh u oklopu\r\nA Vigilante do Amanhã: Ghost in the Shell\r\nДух в броня\r\nGhost in the Shell: Le film\r\nGhost in the Shell: Vigilante del futuro\r\nDuch ve stroji\r\nShabah fi al-haikal\r\nHing anumas\r\nMochveneba Abjarshi\r\nΤο Φάντασμα στο Κέλυφος\r\nPáncélba zárt szellem\r\nRouh dar ghafas\r\nHa\'rouakh ba\'ma\'a\'tefet\r\nGôsuto in za sheru\r\nゴースト・イン・ザ・シェル\r\nRēgs bruņās\r\nDvasia sarvuose\r\nLa vigilante del futuro, Ghost in the Shell\r\nGhost in the Shell - Agente do Futuro\r\nSpirit in cochilie\r\nSpiritul din cochilie\r\nПризрак в доспехах\r\nДух у оклопу\r\nDuša v stroji\r\nDuch v stroji\r\nDuh v školjki\r\nGhost in the Shell: El alma de la máquina\r\n攻殼機動隊\r\nKabuktaki Hayalet\r\nПривид у броні\r\nДух в оболонці\r\nПривид у латах\r\nПривид в латах\r\nLa vigilante del futuro\r\nVỏ Bọc Ma',2017,107,6.3,209630,'English\r\nJapanese','United States\r\nIndia\r\nHong Kong\r\nChina\r\nCanada','Action\r\nCrime\r\nDrama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Rupert Sanders','Shirow Masamune\r\nJamie Moss\r\nWilliam Wheeler\r\nEhren Kruger','Ray Angelic\r\nAri Arad\r\nAvi Arad\r\nHolly Bario\r\nMichael Costigan\r\nJane Nerlinger Evans\r\nTetsu Fujimura\r\nMitsuhisa Ishikawa\r\nYoshinobu Noma\r\nSteven Paul\r\nJeffrey Silver\r\nMaki Terashima-Furuta','Lorne Balfe\r\nClint Mansell','Scarlett Johansson\r\nPilou Asbæk\r\nTakeshi Kitano\r\nJuliette Binoche\r\nMichael Pitt\r\nChin Han\r\nDanusia Samal\r\nLasarus Ratuere\r\nYutaka Izumihara\r\nTawanda Manyimo\r\nPeter Ferdinando\r\nAnamaria Marinca\r\nDaniel Henshall\r\nMana Hira Davis\r\nErroll Anderson\r\nKai Fung Rieck\r\nAndrew Stehlin\r\nMatthias Luafutu\r\nJohn Luafutu\r\nKaori Momoi\r\nKaori Yamamoto\r\nAndrew Morris\r\nAdwoa Aboah\r\nChris Obi\r\nRila Fukushima\r\nMakoto Murata\r\nNatarsha Orsman\r\nJoseph Naufahu\r\nVinnie Bennett\r\nPete Teo\r\nXavier Horan\r\nAllan Henry\r\nBowie Wing Wai Chan\r\nKirt Kishita\r\nDavid Johnson Wood\r\nKate Venables\r\nEmma Coppersmith\r\nTanya Drewery\r\nHannah Tasker-Poland\r\nJacqueline Lee Geurts\r\nShinji Ikefuji\r\nKayla Bechor\r\nLucy Beeler\r\nJulian Gaertner\r\nLily Ge\r\nKate Hawkins\r\nOliver Heinrich\r\nSemiquaver Iafeta\r\nAlex Ishikawa\r\nMatthew Jeng\r\nPhilippe Joly\r\nCandy Knutzen\r\nJack Machiela\r\nRomain Mathelart\r\nGreg McColl\r\nSebastian Mok\r\nAndrew Ng\r\nPatrice Poujol\r\nJordan Rivers\r\nTony Shaw\r\nTricky\r\nRan Wei\r\nMichael Wincott','They did not save your life.

Dr. Ouelet is responsible for the development of the secret project 2571 of a full mechanical body to be connected to a human brain. She uses the brain of a young woman that lost her parents in a cyber attack as subject of a prototype. One year later, the woman is ranked Major and has joined Section 9, an anti-terrorist division commanded by Chief Daisuke Aramaki, working with agents Batou and Togusa. She needs to use a medicine to help the integration of her brain with the mechanical body and has no recollections of her previous life. When Section 9 hunts down the terrorist Kuze, Major learns the secrets about Hanka Robotics and the experiment she was subjected. Now she faces her ultimate enemy: Kuze, a criminal who has managed to hack into the brains of androids and control them.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn the near future, humans are augmented with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or \"shell\", that can integrate a human brain rather than an AI. The sole survivor of a terrorist attack which killed her parents, Mira Killian is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka Robotics CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative. A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist division Section 9 commanded by Chief Daisuke Aramaki, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa.\r\n-\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\nRescued from a devastating terrorist attack, the orphan, Mira Killian, becomes a one-of-a-kind specimen of what begins to be the norm in a not-so-distant future: a cybernetically augmented human whose mind and soul resides in an immaculate synthetic body. As a result, the technologically advanced hybrid--now a resolute counter-cyberterrorism Major--is Sector 9\'s tip of the spear; however, when peculiar hallucinations interpreted as minor glitches start to bombard Mira\'s fragmented mind, suspicions will arise. Could those short and spontaneous outbursts be dormant, yet immortal memories of a suppressed past?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-06-01 16:52:17','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::14\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B-15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSerbia::12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSlovakia::12\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',0),(327,'9544034','The Family Man','Family Man','The Family Man\r\nHomem de Família\r\nΟ Οικογενειάρχης\r\nHombre de familia\r\nСемьянин\r\n衝突邊緣\r\nAile Babası',2019,45,8.8,80066,'Hindi','India','Action\r\nComedy\r\nDrama','Krishna D.K.\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nSuparn Varma','Krishna D.K.\r\nKrishna D.K.\r\nKrishna D.K.\r\nKrishna D.K.\r\nKrishna D.K.\r\nKrishna D.K.\r\nSuman Kumar\r\nSuman Kumar\r\nSuman Kumar\r\nSuman Kumar\r\nSuman Kumar\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nSumit Arora\r\nManoj Kumar Kalaivanan\r\nSuparn Varma\r\nSuparn Varma','Krishna D.K.\r\nRahul Gandhi\r\nRaj Nidimoru\r\nAnuradha Sharma','Ketan Sodha\r\nSachin Sanghvi\r\nDivya Limbasia','Manoj Bajpayee\r\nPriyamani\r\nSharib Hashmi\r\nAshlesha Thakur\r\nVedant Sinha\r\nShahab Ali\r\nShreya Dhanwanthary\r\nSharad Kelkar\r\nDalip Tahil\r\nDarshan Kumaar\r\nSunny Hinduja\r\nAritro Rudraneil Banerjee\r\nPawan Chopra\r\nNeeraj Madhav\r\nMime Gopi\r\nSrikrishna Dayal\r\nVijay Vikram Singh\r\nSamantha Ruth Prabhu\r\nAnand Sami\r\nVipin Sharma\r\nRavindra Vijay\r\nAbhay Verma\r\nSanyukta Timsina\r\nKishore Kumar G.\r\nAzhagam Perumal\r\nM.

He\'s good at his job and is constantly in the air flying from one city to another. He\'s also an accumulator of frequent flyer miles and has a goal: he wants to get to ten million miles. His routine is interrupted by the arrival of Natalie Keener, who thinks the travel is unnecessary and the firings can be done through videoconferencing. Ryan\'s boss loves the idea, but wants Ryan to take Natalie on the road with him to show her how he does it. It proves to be a life lesson for Natalie after one of her counseling sessions goes wrong. Ryan also learns that some of the choices he\'s made have not always been the correct one.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nRyan Bingham\'s job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his \"clients\" has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office, essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls to his way of life.\r\n-\r\nThe Massie Twins\r\n\r\nRyan Bingham works for Omaha-based Career Transition Counseling, whose contracts are in corporate downsizing. In other words, they fire people. Ryan is flying around the U.S. over three hundred twenty days of the year, which he feels is the best part of his job. He does whatever he can to rack up frequent flyer miles, the goal not to use them, but just to accumulate them to a specific number he has in his mind. A secondary job he has is to give motivational speeches on relieving one\'s life of excess physical and emotional baggage. He truly does believe what he espouses as he lives out of his carry-on suitcase (his apartment in Omaha is really in name only), he is not close to his siblings (although he does do a favor for his sister while on his travels), nor does he have or want a significant person in his life. Ryan\'s life may change when the company hires Natalie Keener, a young overachieving woman who recommends that the company change the nature of the work by conducting the \"firings\" via remote computer access. Ryan believes that Natalie does not fully understand the nature of the business, and as such, their boss, Craig Gregory, suggests that she accompany Ryan on a business trip. Ryan is also trying to protect his way of life, which now includes meeting up with a woman named Alex Goran whenever their flight schedules mesh. Like Ryan, Alex, who he met in an airport hotel bar, is constantly travelling for work, and is as equally turned on the by the concepts of \"elite status\" or \"preferred member\" as Ryan is.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-06-08 07:29:04','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::16+\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',13),(329,'4154664','Captain Marvel','Captain Marvel','Captain Marvel\r\nCapitana Marvel\r\nCapitã Marvel\r\nКапитан Марвел\r\nCapitaine Marvel\r\n惊奇队长\r\nKapetanica Marvel\r\nKapten Marvel\r\nKapitani Marveli\r\nMarvel Kapitány\r\nキャプテン・マーベル\r\nKapteine Mārvela\r\nKapitonė Marvel\r\nKapitan Marvel\r\nCaptain Marvel (Capitão Marvel)\r\nКапетан Марвел\r\nStotnica Marvel\r\n驚奇隊長\r\nKaptan Marvel\r\nКапітан Марвел\r\nĐại Úy Marvel',2019,123,6.8,518517,'English','United States\r\nAustralia','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','Anna Boden\r\nRyan Fleck','Anna Boden\r\nRyan Fleck\r\nGeneva Robertson-Dworet\r\nNicole Perlman\r\nMeg LeFauve\r\nAnna Boden\r\nRyan Fleck\r\nGeneva Robertson-Dworet','Victoria Alonso\r\nLouis D\'Esposito\r\nKevin Feige\r\nDavid J.

However, to tie up loose ends and erase the evidence of his ever being a looper, Joe knows that one day his future self will be sent back for him to kill. When this day comes, Joe\'s future self is prepared and escapes, and the two men struggle separately in the past trying to evade capture and attempting to fulfill their own personal agendas.\r\n-\r\nEllen\r\n\r\nIn the year 2047 time travel has yet to be invented. Thirty years later, however, it has. Though immediately outlawed, time-travel technology is quickly appropriated by the mob, and used to cleanly dispose of anyone deemed a threat. The process is simple: When the mob wants someone to disappear, they simply send them back to the year 2047, where an assassin known as a \"looper\" quickly carries out the hit, and disposes of the body. Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt) is one of the most respected Loopers around. Each kill earns him a big payday, and he\'s got big plans to retire to France. Then, one day, as Joe patiently awaits the appearance of his next target near the edge of a remote corn field, he\'s shocked to come face-to-face with his future self (Bruce Willis). When the younger Joe hesitates, the older Joe makes a daring escape. Now, in order to avoid the wrath of his underworld boss (Jeff Daniels), young Joe must \"close the loop\" and kill his older counterpart. Meanwhile, the revelation that a powerful crime boss in the future has set the underworld ablaze pits the two Joes on a violent collision course, with the fate of a devoted mother (Emily Blunt) and her young son hanging in the balance.\r\n\r\nIn 2044, hired killers known as \'loopers\' lie in wait to eliminate targets who are sent back through time by a criminal syndicate. A looper named Joe is confronted with his future self, after he appears looking to carry out a personal mission.\r\n-\r\nvsuperkuns','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-06-13 12:42:23','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nThailand::18\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',18),(332,'0390384','Primer','Primer','Primer\r\nTalálmány\r\nプライマー\r\nDetonatorius\r\nWynalazek\r\nInventia\r\nДетонатор\r\nИзум\r\nОкидач\r\n迴轉時光機\r\nKapsül',2004,77,6.9,104308,'English\r\nFrench','United States','Drama\r\nSci-Fi\r\nThriller','Shane Carruth','Shane Carruth','Shane Carruth','Shane Carruth','Shane Carruth\r\nDavid Sullivan\r\nCasey Gooden\r\nAnand Upadhyaya\r\nCarrie Crawford\r\nJay Butler\r\nJohn Carruth\r\nJuan Tapia\r\nAshley Warren\r\nSamantha Thomson\r\nChip Carruth\r\nDelaney Price\r\nJack Pyland\r\nKeith Bradshaw\r\nAshok Upadhyaya\r\nBrandon Blagg\r\nJon Cook\r\nDavid Joyner\r\nEric De Soualhat','If you always want what you can\'t have, what do you want when you can have anything?\r\n\r\nWhat happens if it actually works?','Four friends/fledgling entrepreneurs, knowing that there\'s something bigger and more innovative than the different error-checking devices they\'ve built, wrestle over their new invention.','Four friends/fledgling entrepreneurs, knowing that there\'s something bigger and more innovative than the different error-checking devices they\'ve built, wrestle over their new invention.\r\n\r\nEngineers Aaron, Abe, Robert and Phillip are working on an invention, the prototype being built in Aaron\'s garage. This project is beyond their day jobs. The project truly does belong to Aaron and Abe, as they use all their free time working on it, primarily trying to overcome the many engineering related problems they\'ve encountered. It is during one of his tests with the invention running that Abe discovers that a protein inside the main unit has multiplied much more rapidly than it could in nature. Rather than the invention being a protein super incubator, Abe, using himself as a guinea pig, and a very meticulous one at that, discovers that the invention can be used as a time machine. In his self experiment, Abe was especially careful not to interfere with his own self in that time warp. Abe passes along this discovery to Aaron, who he expects will tell his wife Kara in what is the sanctity of their marriage, but he doesn\'t want to tell either Robert or Phillip. Much to Abe\'s surprise, Aaron does not want to tell Kara, it being a sole intellectual property of just the two of them, in the process moving the base of operation to a locked storage unit. Aaron\'s plan for the two of them is to use the invention to win big in the stock market by knowing through the time travel what has happened in the market. With two thoughts on the matter now instead of just one, Aaron and Abe may hit some logistical and philosophical roadblocks in how to move forward.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nAt night and on weekends, four men in a suburban garage have built a cottage industry of error-checking devices. But, they know that there is something more. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through trial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, two of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when they are faced with the question, If you always want what you can\'t have, what do you want when you can have anything?\r\n-\r\nSujit R.

Only 72 hours to discover the truth.\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 1989 (the same day the Wall of Berlin falls), Nico is a 12-year-old boy passionate about videotaping himself while playing guitar. He is being raised by his single mother María. On the same night, a 72-hour electric storm breaks out, and Nico looking through his room window witnesses a violent scene in the house of his neighbour, Ángel Prieto. He ventures into the house and stumbles on Hilda Weiss, Prieto\'s wife, lying dead in the house. Running scared from Prieto, who has discovered him in his home, Nico is run over by a passing car and dies as a result. Twenty-five years later, on November 9th, 2014, Vera Roy is a woman who divides her time between working as nurse in the hospital and her family: her husband David Ortiz and her little daughter Gloria. To celebrate moving into their new house in the suburbs, they invite her friend and former boyfriend Aitor Medina and his mother Clara to their house where Vera learns that she and David are living in Nico\'s house and that after his death, Ángel Prieto was arrested and committed suicide in prison three months later. That night after dinner, Vera comes across the old analog TV set and camera equipment used by Nico the same night that the 72-hours storm broke out. After turning the TV on, the storm connects the two devices together as one, and Vera talks to Nico and warns him off his impending death. But after the conversation, Vera wakes up in the hospital in a parallel timeline: puzzled and confused, Vera realizes that she\'s not a nurse but a doctor spending a few days on sick leave after the death of a patient; her daughter Gloria no longer exists; David is married to his former girlfriend, Úrsula; Aitor Medina never was her boyfriend; and Prieto is still alive and happily married to Clara Medina. With her memories constantly crossing both timelines each time that Vera touches someone, she meets Inspector Leyra in an attempt to prove the credibility of her story. Reluctant to believe her, Leyra agrees to investigate with her and both embark on a search for clues and evidence that can help to uncover the truth. With time running out and a few hours left before the storm blows itself out. In the belief that the key to this time riddle is finding out Nico Lasarte\'s whereabouts and proving the murder of Hilda Weiss, Vera tries not only to recover Gloria, but also to arrest Prieto and talk to the child Nico again. Which one of her two parallel lives is real? Is it her previous life a delusion? Will Vera be able to find a way to fix the things before the storm subsides?\r\n-\r\nChockys','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-06-13 12:57:13','','','','','',0,0,0,'Australia::16+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nIndia::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nMexico::TV-MA\r\nPhilippines::18+\r\nPoland::16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::TV-MA\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',16),(337,'0107048','Groundhog Day','Groundhog Day','Groundhog Day\r\nHechizo del tiempo\r\nFeitiço do Tempo\r\nОмагьосан ден\r\nLe jour de la marmotte\r\nBeskrajni dan\r\nNa Hromnice o den více\r\nEn ny dag truer\r\nLõputu küünlapäev\r\nMin dag som murmel\r\nPäiväni murmelina\r\nUn jour sans fin\r\nUnd täglich grüßt das Murmeltier\r\nI mera tis marmotas\r\nΗ μέρα της μαρμότας\r\nIdétlen időkig\r\nRooz-e Groundhog\r\nLakoom Etmol B\'Babokker\r\nRicomincio da capo\r\nIl giorno della marmotta\r\nKoi wa Deja Bu\r\n恋はデジャ・ブ\r\nMurkšķa diena\r\nŠvilpiko diena\r\nDzień Świstaka\r\nO Feitiço do Tempo\r\nZiua cârtiței\r\nДень сурка\r\nДан мрмота\r\nNa Hromnice o deň viac\r\nNa Hromnice\r\nNeuveriteľný deň\r\nNeskončen dan\r\nAtrapat en el temps\r\nAtrapado en el tiempo\r\nMåndag hela veckan\r\n今天暫時停止\r\nBugün Aslında Dündü\r\nДень бабака\r\nSug\'ur kuni\r\nNgày Chuột Chũi',1993,101,8,604841,'English\r\nFrench\r\nItalian','United States','Comedy\r\nDrama\r\nFantasy\r\nRomance','Harold Ramis','Danny Rubin\r\nDanny Rubin\r\nHarold Ramis','Trevor Albert\r\nC.O.

This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the \'following\' day, he discovers that it\'s Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realisation that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.\r\n-\r\nRob Hartill\r\n\r\nMisanthropic TV weatherman/broadcaster, Phil Connors, is annoyed and despondent when he\'s assigned the job of covering the annual Groundhog festivities in the small \"Hick\" town of Punxsutawney - making this his fourth in a row. The only noticeable upside is his attractive and good-natured producer. But the real nightmare begins when Phil ends up reliving the same day (Groundhog Day) over, and over again. Unable to leave the town due to a severe blizzard, and with no end in sight, Phil struggles to find a way to escape (and ultimately make the best of) his seemingly hopeless situation.\r\n-\r\nS. Lagan\r\n\r\nTV weatherman Phil Connors is cynical, to say the least, and having to go yet again to Punxsutawney, Pa. on February 2 to see if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow isn\'t his idea of fun. He is grumpy with his segment producer Rita and downright nasty with cameraman Larry. He doesn\'t take the shadow business at all seriously but the next morning, awakens to find he is reliving the same day. Initially disbelieving and fighting what is happening to him, Phil eventually accepts that he will relive the same day over and over again. He uses the opportunity to acquire new skills - piano playing and ice carving among them - and soon becomes the most admired man in Punxsutawney. However, just how many times he relives the day is anyone\'s guess.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nPhil Connors is the arrogant and egotistical weatherman for local station WPBH-TV Pittsburgh. He has disdain for those with whom he works as well as for his viewers. But he has the most disdain for Groundhog Day held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, which he is to cover for the fourth time in his career, this year with Rita and Larry, the station\'s new producer and cameraman respectively. Phil wants to get in and out of Punxsutawney as quickly as possible, but a snowstorm forces the threesome to stay an extra night in town after the Groundhog Day festivities. When Phil awakens the next morning, he is experiencing what he thinks is déjà vu. In reality, he is experiencing that Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney all over again. The same happens the following day and the following. As Phil relives that same Groundhog Day over and over again, he goes through a myriad of highs and lows. But as he comes to the realization that Groundhog Day may be his fate for eternity, he also comes to other realizations, such as that his actions have no long term consequences, but that knowledge, especially as it relates to Rita, can be a powerful and dangerous thing. But he is given opportunity after opportunity to get the day \"right.\"\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2020-06-23','','2020-06-16 14:37:47','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-10\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::10\r\nPhilippines::PG\r\nPoland::b.o.\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::T\r\nSweden::7\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',0),(340,'1951265','The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1','Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1','The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1\r\nLojërat e Urisë: Grifsha - Pjesa 1\r\nLos juegos del hambre: Sinsajo - Parte 1\r\nAcliq Oyunlari: Adamoynadan Zig-Zig - 1-ci Bölüm\r\nJogos Vorazes: A Esperança - Parte 1\r\nИгрите на глада: Сойка-присмехулка - част 1\r\nHunger Games: La révolte - Partie 1\r\nLos Juegos del Hambre: Sinsajo Parte 1\r\nIgre gladi: Sojka rugalica 1. dio\r\nHunger Games: Síla vzdoru 1. cást\r\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay - del 1\r\nNäljamängud: Pilapasknäär - 1.osa\r\nNälkäpeli - Matkijanärhi, osa 1\r\nHunger Games: La Révolte - Partie 1\r\nDie Tribute von Panem - Mockingjay: Teil 1\r\nThe Hunger Games: Επανάσταση - Μέρος I\r\nΑγώνες πείνας: Επανάσταση - Μέρος I\r\nAz éhezők viadala: A kiválasztott - 1. rész\r\nMishakei Hara\'av: Orvani Hakyan\r\nHunger Games: Il canto della rivolta - Parte I\r\nハンガー・ゲーム FINAL：レジスタンス\r\nBada spēles: Zobgaļsīlis. 1. daļa\r\nBado žaidynes: Strazdas giesmininkas. 1 dalis\r\nLos juegos del hambre: Sinsajo - Parte1\r\nHunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1\r\nIgrzyska śmierci: Kosogłos.

As her squad starts to get smaller and smaller, will she make it to the Capitol? Will she get revenge on Snow or will her target change?

Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed.\r\n-\r\nstatmanjeff','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-06-24 04:35:37','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(342,'0780536','In Bruges','In Bruges','In Bruges\r\nEscondidos en Brujas\r\nNa Mira do Chefe\r\nВ Брюж\r\nBienvenue à Bruges\r\nEscondidos\r\nKriminalci na godišnjem\r\nV Bruggách\r\nPalgamõrvarid Brügges\r\nKukkoilijat\r\nBons baisers de Bruges\r\nBrügge sehen... und sterben?\r\nApostoli stin Bruges\r\nΑποστολή στην Μπριζ\r\nErőszakik\r\nIn Bruges - La coscienza dell\'assassino\r\nヒットマンズ・レクイエム\r\nReiz Brigē\r\nReikalai Briugėje\r\nEn Brujas\r\nUndercover i Brügge\r\nUnas vacaciones diferentes\r\nNajpierw strzelaj, potem zwiedzaj\r\nEm Bruges\r\nЗалечь на дно в Брюгге\r\nУ Брижу\r\nГангстери на одмору\r\nV Brugách\r\nMorilca na kolektivca\r\n殺手沒有假期\r\nЗалягти на дно в Брюге\r\nفي بروج\r\nCặp Đôi Sát Thủ Ở Bruges',2008,107,7.9,409707,'English','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Comedy\r\nCrime\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Martin McDonagh','Martin McDonagh','Jeff Abberley\r\nJulia Blackman\r\nGraham Broadbent\r\nPeter Czernin\r\nSarah Harvey\r\nTessa Ross\r\nRonaldo Vasconcellos','Carter Burwell','Elizabeth Berrington\r\nRudy Blomme\r\nOlivier Bonjour\r\nMark Donovan\r\nAnn Elsley\r\nColin Farrell\r\nJean-Marc Favorin\r\nRalph Fiennes\r\nBrendan Gleeson\r\nEric Godon\r\nZeljko Ivanek\r\nSachi Kimura\r\nAnna Madeley\r\nLouis Nummy\r\nClémence Poésy\r\nJordan Prentice\r\nJérémie Renier\r\nThekla Reuten\r\nTheo Stevenson\r\nInez Stinton\r\nEmily Thorling\r\nAngel Witney\r\nBonnie Witney\r\nRan Yaniv\r\nStephanie Carey\r\nJamie Edgell\r\nSusan Ateh\r\nSommer Garcia\r\nCiarán Hinds\r\nLiz Imperio\r\nArnold Montey\r\nCarmen Osbahr\r\nRobert Roldan\r\nBomber Hurley Smith','Shoot first.

Harry will be in touch with further instructions. While they wait for Harry\'s call, Ken, following Harry\'s advice, takes in the sights of the medieval city with great appreciation. But the charms of Bruges are lost on the simpler Ray, who is already despondent over the innocent death, especially as it was his first job. Things change for Ray when he meets Chloe, part of a film crew shooting a movie starring an American dwarf named Jimmy. When Harry\'s instructions arrive, Ken, for whom the job is directed, isn\'t sure if he can carry out the new job, especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairytale Bruges. While Ken waits for the inevitable arrival into Bruges of an angry Harry, who feels he must clean up matters on his own, Ray is dealing with his own problems, not only with Harry, but with a Canadian couple and a half-blind thief named Eirik. Ray hopes he can count on both Chloe and Ken to help him carve out a new life for himself. In the end, Harry, involved in an incident with Jimmy, may have to keep to his own principles.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nA Christmas story. Should one who killed a child be allowed to live? Harry Waters, a London thug, sends Irish hitmen Ken and Ray to Bruges to lie low after a job goes awry in a London church. Ken\'s the old hand, fascinated by the Medieval, with a fatherly attitude toward Ray, who\'s young and bored but chastened after the London job. Ray\'s disposition changes when he meets Chloë, a hip young woman who sells drugs on the local set of a movie featuring Jimmy, an American dwarf. Harry calls with irrevocable instructions. Ken balks, setting up a showdown in the town square. A pregnant innkeeper, dumdum bullets, and a code of conduct play into the resolution.\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe Irish hit-men Ken and Ray are sent by the Londoner mobster Harry Waters to the medieval Belgium city of Bruges in Christmas after an awry job in a London church. Ray bungles it. While Ken enjoys the historic city, Ray feels completely bored and misses his home. Ray meets the small time drug-dealer and crook Chloë, who sells drug to the cast and crew of a movie that is filmed in Bruges, and has an incident with a Canadian tourist and later with Chloë\'s boyfriend. Meanwhile Harry, who has an stringent code of principles, gives Ken special orders.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-06-24 06:50:39','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::16\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::12\r\nIreland::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',16),(343,'1019452','A Serious Man','Serious Man','A Serious Man\r\nUn hombre serio\r\nUm Homem Sério\r\nСериозен човек\r\nUn homme sérieux\r\nOzbiljan čovjek\r\nTõsine mees\r\nEnas sovaros anthropos\r\nΈνας σοβαρός άνθρωπος\r\nEgy komoly ember\r\nYehudi Tov\r\nSerious Man\r\nシリアスマン\r\nRimtas vyrukas\r\nPoważny człowiek\r\nUn tip serios\r\nСерьёзный человек\r\nOzbiljan čovek\r\nZresni se\r\nUn tipo serio\r\n正經好人\r\nCiddi bir adam\r\nСерйозна людина',2009,106,7.1,140066,'English\r\nYiddish\r\nHebrew','United Kingdom\r\nFrance\r\nUnited States','Comedy\r\nDrama','Ethan Coen\r\nJoel Coen','Joel Coen\r\nEthan Coen','Tim Bevan\r\nEthan Coen\r\nJoel Coen\r\nEric Fellner\r\nRobert Graf','Carter Burwell','Michael Stuhlbarg\r\nRichard Kind\r\nFred Melamed\r\nSari Lennick\r\nAaron Wolff\r\nJessica McManus\r\nPeter Breitmayer\r\nBrent Braunschweig\r\nDavid Kang\r\nBenjamin Portnoe\r\nJack Swiler\r\nAndrew S.

Though seeking meaning and answers amidst his turmoils, he seems to keep sinking.\r\n\r\nBloomington, Minnesota, 1967: Jewish physics lecturer Larry Gopnik is a serious and a very put-upon man. His daughter is stealing from him to save up for a nose job, his pot-head son, who gets stoned at his own bar-mitzvah, only wants him round to fix the TV aerial and his useless brother Arthur is an unwelcome house guest. But both Arthur and Larry get turfed out into a motel when Larry\'s wife Judy, who wants a divorce, moves her lover, Sy, into the house and even after Sy\'s death in a car crash they are still there. With lawyers\' bills mounting for his divorce, Arthur\'s criminal court appearances and a land feud with a neighbour Larry is tempted to take the bribe offered by a student to give him an illegal exam pass mark. And the rabbis he visits for advice only dole out platitudes. Still God moves in mysterious - and not always pleasant - ways, as Larry and his family will find out.\r\n-\r\ndon @ minifie-1\r\n\r\n1967. Mild-mannered Larry Gopnik, living in suburban Minneapolis with his wife Judith and their two children, teenaged Sarah and preteen Danny, is a Physics professor at a local college. Larry lets life wash over him, especially as it has not placed any major bumps yet along the way, with a few upcoming perks being that he is on a tenure track, the decision to be made soon, the deliberation by the tenure committee which he is assured is only a formality, and Danny will soon have his bar mitzvah. Minor bumps include Sarah and Danny constantly being at each other\'s throats, especially about money, all three of his family members treating him more as a fixture than a husband or father, and his unemployed mathematician brother Arthur living with them in their already crowded house, he sleeping on their sofa. What Larry does not know about his life is that Danny is more interested in listening to Jefferson Airplane and smoking weed than he is in his Hebrew studies for the bar mitzvah. Larry believes that his Jewish faith will keep him safe. However, things slowly start to fall off the rails for Larry. Judith asks for a divorce in falling in love with a mutual friend, effete widower Sy Ableman. Judith, in the process, wants proverbially everything in the settlement, leaving Larry in a financial bind. Larry is having problems with a South Korean exchange student named Clive, who may or may not be bribing him for a passing grade, which becomes more clear as time goes on. Although he is further assured that they are not an issue, he learns that someone is sending poison pen letters about him to the tenure committee, most probably Clive in what seems to be his campaign to get a good grade or else. Their neighbor, Brandt, is slowly encroaching on their property. Someone has signed him up with the Columbia House record club, they who are hounding him for payment for records he has never received. And Arthur get into some problems with the law. One distraction are his new neighbors, the Samskys, voluptuous Mrs. Samsky who has a penchant for sunbathing nude in their back yard. In the process, Larry looks for some answers to all these problems, especially from his faith. He wants to speak most specifically to Rabbi Marshak, the senior rabbi at his synagogue who is now more a figurehead than practicing rabbi. As such, even trying to see Rabbi Marshak, let alone speak to him, is more difficult than just wanting it to happen.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-06-24 06:54:10','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::15+',13),(344,'1392214','Prisoners','Prisoners','Prisoners\r\nLa sospecha\r\nEsirler\r\nOs Suspeitos\r\nЗатворници\r\nPrisonniers\r\n囚徒\r\nIntriga\r\nZatočene\r\nZmizení\r\nVangistatud\r\nVangitut\r\n罪迷宮\r\nFogságban\r\nAsirim\r\nPurizunâzu\r\nプリズナーズ\r\nGūsteknes\r\nKaliniai\r\nLabirynt\r\nRaptadas\r\nPrizonieri\r\nПленницы\r\nЗатвореници\r\nUgrabljeni\r\nPrisioneros\r\nPresoners\r\n私法爭鋒\r\nKhu Dueat Chueat Pom Dip\r\nTutsak\r\nПолонянки\r\nAsiralar\r\nLần Theo Dấu Vết',2013,153,8.1,662540,'English','United States','Crime\r\nDrama\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Denis Villeneuve','Aaron Guzikowski','Kira Davis\r\nBroderick Johnson\r\nAdam Kolbrenner\r\nAndrew A.

Keller Dover is facing every parent\'s worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child\'s life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?\r\n-\r\nWarner Bros. Pictures\r\n\r\nWhen two girls go missing, the families call the police. The brother of one of the girls says that an RV was parked on the street. The police find the RV and the man inside is a mentally challenged man. The detective in charge questions him but says nothing. The father of one of the girls tells the detective to keep him locked up so they can work on him. But he says without more evidence they have to let him go. When the father learns of this he goes to confront the man and the man says something which makes the father think he knows something. So he grabs him and works on him to make him talk but he doesn\'t. The detective continues to try and find the girls.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nOn Thanksgiving, Keller Dover, his wife Grace, their teenage son Ralph and their little daughter Anna go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch, his wife Nancy, their teenage daughter Eliza and their little daughter Joy to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them. Later the families realize that the girls went alone and have vanished, and they call the police department. Detective Loki is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones, Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that \"the girls have not cried when he left them\". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn a town in northeastern Pennsylvania, Keller and Grace Dover, Franklin and Nancy Birch, and their respective offspring - each couple with a teenager and adolescent apiece - are best friends. While the two families are celebrating Thanksgiving together, the two adolescent girls, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, go missing. Based on events earlier in the day, the two families believe that the girls were abducted by whoever lives in the camper van parked in their neighborhood. Their beliefs are strengthened after they meet the resident of the camper, Alex Jones, a mentally childlike young man who is supported in every respect by his overprotective aunt, Holly Jones, and based on other subsequent evidence about Alex that emerges. However, Detective Loki, the lead police investigator, is pretty certain that Alex did not abduct the girls, he instead initially following leads of known sex offenders and pedophiles in the area. In addition, Loki has no evidence to hold Alex in custody, placing him at odds especially with Keller, who is certain that Alex is the one who abducted the girls. While Loki continues his investigation with Keller accusing him of not doing his job by following what he considers are pointless leads, Keller decides he has to take matters into his own hands. He has to decide how much he will involve Grace, Franklin and Nancy in getting Alex to divulge where the girls are by any means possible. His decisions as in who he will involve in getting Alex to talk may depend on how like-minded he believes the other three are, they who may be as devastated as he is, but who may neither be certain that Alex is the perpetrator or go to the same extremes as he to get the information from Alex.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop of what should have been a happy Thanksgiving dinner, a terrible case of a mysterious abduction unfolds, as Anna, the six-year-old daughter of the small-town carpenter, Keller Dover, and her best friend, Joy, vanish without a trace. As time is against the desperate father, the only lead points at troubled Alex Jones; however, due to lack of evidence, Detective Loki knows that the alleged prime suspect will soon be free. Now, the odds are against them, and Keller will have to take matters into his own hands, even if his reckless decision threatens to put his freedom at risk. Will he ever see the girls again, alive and in one piece?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-06-24 06:56:49','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(345,'2267998','Gone Girl','Gone Girl','Gone Girl\r\nPerdida\r\nItmis Qiz\r\nGarota Exemplar\r\nНе казвай сбогом\r\nLes apparences\r\n消失的爱人\r\nNestala\r\nZmizelá\r\nKvinden der forsvandt\r\nGone girl - kiltti tyttö\r\nGone Girl - Das perfekte Opfer\r\nΤο κορίτσι που εξαφανίστηκε\r\n失蹤罪\r\nHoltodiglan\r\nDokhtar-e gomshodeh\r\nNe\'elemet\r\nL\'amore bugiardo - Gone Girl\r\nゴーン・ガール\r\nNeatrodamā\r\nDingusi\r\nZaginiona dziewczyna\r\nEm Parte Incerta\r\nFata dispărută\r\nИсчезнувшая\r\nИшчезла\r\nStratené Dievča\r\nNi je več\r\nFind Me\r\nNa Reul Chajajwo\r\n控制\r\nLen Son Hai\r\nKayıp Kız\r\nЗагублена\r\nCô Gái Mất Tích',2014,149,8.1,934809,'English','United States','Drama\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','David Fincher','Gillian Flynn\r\nGillian Flynn','Ceán Chaffin\r\nJim Davidson\r\nLeslie Dixon\r\nJoshua Donen\r\nArnon Milchan\r\nBruna Papandrea\r\nReese Witherspoon','Trent Reznor\r\nAtticus Ross','Ben Affleck\r\nRosamund Pike\r\nNeil Patrick Harris\r\nTyler Perry\r\nCarrie Coon\r\nKim Dickens\r\nPatrick Fugit\r\nDavid Clennon\r\nLisa Banes\r\nMissi Pyle\r\nEmily Ratajkowski\r\nCasey Wilson\r\nLola Kirke\r\nBoyd Holbrook\r\nSela Ward\r\nLee Norris\r\nJamie McShane\r\nLeonard Kelly-Young\r\nKathleen Rose Perkins\r\nPete Housman\r\nLynn Adrianna Freedman\r\nMark Atteberry\r\nDarin Cooper\r\nKate Campbell\r\nBrett Leigh\r\nAntonio St. James\r\nLauren Glazier\r\nJulia Prud\'homme\r\nCooper Thornton\r\nCasey Ruggieri\r\nCyd Strittmatter\r\nAshley Didion\r\nLexis Nutt\r\nL.A.

Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick\'s portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?\r\n-\r\nTwentieth Century Fox\r\n\r\nNick Dunne, a small town guy who made good in the big city as a magazine writer blames the recession and the loss of his job for the decline of his marriage to his intellectually superior wife with a substantial trust fund. Questions of his motives and character begin to arise after his wife\'s disappearance on the morning of their fifth anniversary. As the search for his missing wife plays out over the ensuing days, guilty suspicions are fueled into a national frenzy by the media circus camped outside his house. Is this idyllic, everyman truly capable of murdering his wife?\r\n-\r\nMalcolmJTaylor\r\n\r\nNick and Amy Dunne are a couple living in a small town in Missouri. Nick calls the authorities when she goes missing but something is off about his behavior. Is he hiding something? Is he sad or distraught enough?

Nick, the husband now realizes that his wife, Amy has gone missing. He calls the local authorities for reporting the situation. Along with the time and the local searching program, the progress becoming blurred between Nick\'s version of the story or the new investigation result - that Nick suspected of killing his wife. Now, Nick struggles for convincing the media, telling them if he didn\'t kill his wife, and probe the cryptic clues from his own wife.\r\n-\r\nGusde\r\n\r\nUnder very curious and suspicious circumstances, the former New York City columnist, Nick Dunne, finds out that his home in Missouri has been intruded; his front door half-open; shattered glass everywhere, and his popular author wife, Amy, inexplicably missing. Amid an unbridled media feeding frenzy, inevitably, Nick\'s life comes under the spotlight, as the experienced detective, Rhonda Boney, delves deeper and deeper into the husband\'s seemingly perfect image. As a result, half-truths and full lies entangle Nick more and more in a foggy reality where nothing is what it seems. Is the caring family man, indeed, a cold-blooded murderer?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Nick Dunne\'s wife transpires into a media frenzy, leaving him frantic and in desperate need of a lawyer - but why?

Few dare to rebel against him. A young thief, whose love was taken captive by the god, seeks to dethrone and defeat Set with the aid of the powerful god Horus.\r\n-\r\nJames Pasier\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Egypt, the god Ra has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris and the desert by his son Set. During the coronation of Horus by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek and his beloved wife Zaya that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set\'s architect Urshu, convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus\' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the underworld. They team up and soon Horus\' lover Hathor, the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSet in the mythology of ancient Egypt, the world is flat and the Egyptian gods live among humans. The gods differ from humans by their greater height, golden blood, and ability to transform into their divine forms. A young thief named Bek and his love Zaya are attending the coronation of Horus. During the ceremony, Osiris is killed by his extremely jealous brother Set, who seizes the throne and declares a new regime where the dead will have to pay with riches to pass into the afterlife. Horus is stripped of his eyes, the source of his power, and almost killed. His love, Hathor pleads with Set to spare him and he is instead exiled in exchange for Egypt\'s surrender..\r\n\r\nIn an Age of physically ruling Pharaonic gods, Osiris assembles all Egypt\'s capital to witness transferring his happy reign of the Nile kingdom to his conceited son, Horus. However, during the ceremony Osiris\'s brother Seth, who was practically banished by their grandfather sun god Ra to rule the barren desert lands, marches in with an invincible magical army to seize the crown, wed love goddess Hathor, lock her blinded fiance Horus in his tomb, and install a reign of terror over Egypt, reduced to slavish drudgery and denying a happy afterlife to all but those who can buy themselves out of hell. Crafty knave thief Bek is madly in love with Zaya, the slave secretary of royal architect Urshu, but gets caught sneaking in the master\'s palace, enraging him enough to kill her during a chase in the capital. Bek vows to do the impossible: restore Zaya to life in exchange for the eye of Horus, the magical seat of his power, to overthrow Seth. The very deal is a false promise, they need to overcome magical obstacles and help from Hathor and Ra to prepare for a face-off with Seth.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-06-27 11:37:06','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::12A\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::10-12\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(348,'1798709','Her','Her','Her\r\nElla\r\nO.\r\nEla\r\nТя\r\nElle\r\n她\r\nOna\r\nHende\r\nTemake\r\nDikos tis\r\nΔικός της\r\nA nő\r\nOu\r\nHee\r\nLei\r\nher/世界でひとつの彼女\r\nViņa\r\nJi\r\nUma História de Amor\r\nEa\r\nОна\r\nGeu-nyeo\r\n雲端情人\r\nRak Dang Fang Chat\r\nAşk\r\nВона',2013,126,8,581699,'English','United States','Drama\r\nRomance\r\nSci-Fi','Spike Jonze','Spike Jonze','Chelsea Barnard\r\nMegan Ellison\r\nNatalie Farrey\r\nSpike Jonze\r\nVincent Landay\r\nDaniel Lupi\r\nSamantha Morton\r\nThomas Patrick Smith','Arcade Fire','Joaquin Phoenix\r\nLynn Adrianna Freedman\r\nLisa Renee Pitts\r\nGabe Gomez\r\nChris Pratt\r\nArtt Butler\r\nMay Lindstrom\r\nRooney Mara\r\nBill Hader\r\nKristen Wiig\r\nBrian Johnson\r\nScarlett Johansson\r\nAmy Adams\r\nMatt Letscher\r\nSpike Jonze\r\nOlivia Wilde\r\nDavid Azar\r\nGuy Lewis\r\nMelanie Seacat\r\nPramode Kumar\r\nEvelyn Edwards\r\nSteve Zissis\r\nDane White\r\nNicole Grother\r\nJames Ozasky\r\nSamantha Sarakanti\r\nLuka Jones\r\nGracie Prewitt\r\nClaudia Choi\r\nLaura Kai Chen\r\nPortia Doubleday\r\nSoko\r\nWendy Leon\r\nLil Buck\r\nRobert Benard\r\nLisa Cohen\r\nGrant Samson\r\nBrian Cox\r\nMarc Abbink\r\nLeo Baligaya\r\nJoan Blair\r\nFreedom Bridgewater\r\nKathleen Carr\r\nSeth Carr\r\nHallie Marie Chaney\r\nGlenda Chism\r\nLee Christian\r\nAndy Dale\r\nSandra Daubert\r\nNico David\r\nRick L.

When he\'s not working as a letter writer, his down time is spent playing video games and occasionally hanging out with friends. He decides to purchase the new OS1, which is advertised as the world\'s first artificially intelligent operating system, \"It\'s not just an operating system, it\'s a consciousness,\" the ad states. Theodore quickly finds himself drawn in with Samantha, the voice behind his OS1. As they start spending time together they grow closer and closer and eventually find themselves in love. Having fallen in love with his OS, Theodore finds himself dealing with feelings of both great joy and doubt. As an OS, Samantha has powerful intelligence that she uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn\'t, but how does she help him deal with his inner conflict of being in love with an OS?\r\n-\r\nBob Philpot\r\n\r\nIn today\'s world, much is accomplished through the use of computer systems which use voice recognition, those computer systems which in turn communicate to their user often through a generated voice. Theodore Twombly, who works as a writer of computer-generated handwritten letters for clients, is an introverted man on the verge of divorce from his long time love, Catherine. He is hanging onto his marriage for dear life. Beyond his purely platonic relationship with a longtime friend, the married Amy, Theodore is having problems moving onto other satisfying female relationships, either romantically or even sexually. He eventually realizes he is falling for his confidante who has become possibly his best friend, Samantha, the name he has given to the artificial intelligence operating system that powers all his personal technological devices. As Samantha is designed to cater to Theodore\'s needs, she evolves to a point of falling for him as well. Beyond the fact that Samantha does not have a body, they have to come up with ways of making the relationship into one truly fulfilling in every component. Three of the many questions that may arise are whether Theodore\'s relationship with Samantha is preventing him from having a more satisfying relationship with a female human, whether a human and a computer operating system truly can be bonded in all critical aspects, and whether Samantha\'s quick evolution means she will evolve even further to her own form of self-fulfillment.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn a near future, lonely Theodore works writing beautiful handwritten letters in a company, and is divorcing from his wife Catherine. In his leisure time, he usually recalls the good moments of his life with Catherine and likes to play a new videogame. His best friend is his neighbor Amy, who is married to Charles. One day, Theodore sees the advertisement of a new operating system called OS-1 that is announced as the first artificially intelligent operating system and he decides to buy it. After the installation, he has a conversation with a seductive female voice and when he asks her name, she tells that she is Samantha. Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nSensitive letter writer Theodore has just ended his marriage. Lonely, he goes out to buy an artificially intelligent Operating System that promises to give him everything he needs. Samantha is more than his average OS. She does secretarial work for him but also becomes his friend whenever he\'s lonely. They go out on adventures and travel together. He becomes the physical feet to get them places, and she the new eyes in which to see the world. Their intimate moments soon turn into love and they start an unusual relationship between OS and human. Things get complicated as they deal with Theodore\'s complex emotions and Samantha\'s inability to provide physical comfort. What happens to an OS when its consciousness is altered? Or to a sensitive man who doubts his emotions?\r\n-\r\nMarielle\r\n\r\nTheodore Twombly (Phoenix) has built his career on expressing the emotions that others cannot. His job is to pen heartfelt, deeply personal letters to complete strangers based on details provided by the clients of the company he works for, and he has a knack for finding just the right words for every occasion. Meanwhile, reluctant to sign the papers that will finalize his divorce to his childhood sweetheart, depressed Theodore has slowly withdrawn from his supportive social circle, which includes his longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams), herself floundering in a failed marriage. When Theodore purchases a new state-of-the-art computer operating system with the ability to learn and grow with the user, he sits down at his desk and prepares to get his life in order. Adopting the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the perceptive software slowly begins to bring Theodore out of his shell by encouraging him to start dating again, and joining him everywhere he goes. Very quickly, their relationship turns intimate, with Theodore teaching Samantha what it means to feel human and Samantha giving him the strength to walk away from his failed marriage. Things soon get complicated, however, when Samantha\'s rapidly evolving knowledge base begins to alter the very core of their relationship..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-07-06 10:57:28','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::14A\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::16',18),(349,'0475784','Westworld','Westworld','Westworld\r\nЗападен свят\r\n西部世界\r\nWestworld - Dove tutto è concesso\r\nウエストワールド\r\nVakarų pasaulis\r\nМир Дикого Запада\r\nЗападни свет\r\nZápadný svet\r\n西方極樂園\r\nСвіт «Дикий Захід»\r\nThế Giới Viễn Tây',2016,62,8.6,466002,'English','United States','Drama\r\nMystery\r\nSci-Fi','Richard J.

He experiences three things on the same day, beginning of war, getting a bike and sees the arrival of Malèna in town. Through his eyes, we see the curse of beauty and loneliness of Malena, whose husband is presumed to be dead, and through his soul we see his love for her.\r\n-\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nAs Italy enters World War II, the Sicilian twelve-year-old boy, Renato, gets his first bicycle, and, above all, sets eyes on the sleepy town\'s most beautiful woman: Malèna, the statuesque newcomer whose husband is off to war. Desired by every man in town, and, at the same time, despised by their jealous wives, Malèna is now the centre of attention and everyone\'s favourite subject of an increasingly rancorous gossip. Then, with Malèna\'s husband presumed killed in action, Renato\'s starry-eyed infatuation turns into obsession, as the unattainable object of his desire becomes, more and more, a victim of her incomparable beauty. Now, Malèna\'s fall from grace is inevitable. Will Renato finally get up his nerve to protect his eternal fantasy, Malèna?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nOn the day in 1940 that Italy enters the war, two things happen to the 12-year-old Renato: he gets his first bike, and he gets his first look at Malèna. She is a beautiful, silent outsider who\'s moved to this Sicilian town to be with her husband, Nino. He promptly goes off to war, leaving her to the lustful eyes of the men and the sharp tongues of the women.

In a place known as \'The Barrens\', a group of seven kids are united by their horrifying and strange encounters with an evil clown and their determination to kill It.\r\n-\r\nEmma Chapman\r\n\r\nAfter recent cases of disappearing local kids in the town of Derry, Maine, IT follows a group of kids dubbed \"The Losers\' Club\" in the summer of 1989 and their discovery and scary encounters of a shape-shifting demonic entity, known to return every 27 years and preys on your own personal fears.\r\n-\r\nIanFLC\r\n\r\nWhen young children in the little town Derry, Maine goes missing a group of seven kids find out that the killer is not a man. The killer is the evil clown Pennywise who can shapeshift into the thing you are most afraid of. The kids, also known as the Losers Club, decide to fight and kill It. But how can you fight something who knows all your biggest fears?\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1989, a shape-shifting monster, Pennywise who disguises itself as a clown murdered Georgie.

Against the backdrop of anguished remorse after the recent death of the innocent six-year-old, Georgie Denbrough, the close-knit band of school pariahs, or The Losers\' Club--Georgie\'s troubled older brother, Bill; the bullied new classmate, Ben Hanscom; the ill-treated, Beverly Marsh; the playful, Richie Tozier; home school kid, Mike Hanlon; the asthmatic, Eddie Kaspbrak; and the fastidious, Stanley Uris--pluck up the courage to confront their well-hidden childhood fears and the blood-curdling clown-like shape-shifter who lives in their twisted visions. Nevertheless, is the malevolent bright-eyed demon, indeed, the nightmarish creature that horrifies Derry? Either way, the otherworldly entity needs to feed, and the young team of defenders are no match for him.

Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise -- now more powerful than ever.\r\n\r\nDerry, Maine. A small town with a terrible curse. Every 27 years, an ancient being comes up from the sewer depths to feed off of the fear of children. Since it\'s defeat in 1989, Pennywise has grown hungry, and is now back with a vengeance. If the losers club doesn\'t defeat him this time, their worst fear will become a reality, with nothing to stop him. The clock is ticking. Who\'s going to be scared first?\r\n\r\nAfter the survivors\' irrevocable blood oath in It (2017)--and nearly three incident-free decades after the blood-soaked encounter with the demonic shape-shifter, Pennywise the Dancing Clown--the estranged members of the Losers\' Club find themselves before a dreadful obligation: to return to Derry and honour their promise. Once again, the brutal murder of an innocent awakens the grisly memories of the past, reuniting the old band of companions, as the nightmarish monster has come back from the shadows of oblivion to terrorise the small town, intent on revenge and slaughter. Now, whether they like it or not, the now-successful Losers must probe deep into the fundamental fears of their troubled childhood, and summon up the courage to bring the terrible creature\'s reign of terror to a close. One last battle awaits Derry\'s remaining fighters of the supernatural. Will this final confrontation mark the end of the Losers Club, or will it be the end of the dreadful thing they call IT?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-07-27 04:53:04','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBelgium::12\r\nBrazil::16\r\nBulgaria::D\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nEcuador::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nLuxembourg::16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMaldives::18+\r\nMalta::15\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::15\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Africa::18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-15\r\nThailand::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUkraine::18\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C18',12),(354,'7556122','The Old Guard','Old Guard','The Old Guard\r\nLa vieja guardia\r\nБезсмъртни бойци\r\nStara garda\r\nNesmrtelná stráž\r\nΗ Παλιά Φρουρά\r\nA halhatatlan gárda\r\nオールド・ガード\r\nA Velha Guarda\r\nБессмертная гвардия\r\nСтара гарда\r\nNesmrteľná stráž\r\n不死軍團\r\nÖlümsüzlük\r\nСтара гвардія\r\nThe Old Guard: Những Chiến Binh Bất Tử',2020,125,6.7,153070,'English\r\nArabic\r\nFrench\r\nItalian','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nFantasy\r\nThriller','Gina Prince-Bythewood','Greg Rucka\r\nGreg Rucka\r\nLeandro Fernandez','Ahmed Abounouom\r\nKarim Abouobayd\r\nA.J.

He has no real friends and spends most of his time away from work by himself. Despite having an interest in the opposite sex philosophically as witnessed by his constant and uncontrollable morning erections, he is still a virgin. He never planned not to have sex, but it became more and more difficult to have that first experience as he got older, to the point where, to him, it became a reality for his life. When his work colleagues find out, some mock and ridicule him, while a small group comprised of Dave, Jay and Cal take it upon themselves to help him get laid, despite each of three having their own relationship issue making them perhaps not the best people to provide advice or assistance. Andy also gets some unexpected suggestions from some standing on the sidelines of his life. Beyond that advice, Andy has to be the one to take the ultimate step to reality, he not only having no practical experience, but also no theoretical experience in that he doesn\'t even watch or have interest in porn or masturbate. Some of the advice he receives centers on the actual woman who should be his first time. Regardless of that advice, he decides that the woman he truly wants is Trish, a specialty retailer with a somewhat useless bricks and mortar outlet across the street from the electronics store. As Andy pursues then eventually falls for Trish, he has to decide how much of his true self he will divulge to her.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nForty-year-old Andy Stitzer has done quite a few things in his life. He\'s got a cushy job stamping invoices at an electronics superstore, a nice apartment with a proud collection of action figures and comic books, good friends, a nice attitude. But there\'s just one little thing he hasn\'t quite gotten around to doing yet--something most people have done by his age. Done a lot. Andy\'s never, ever, ever had sex--not even by accident. So is that such a big deal? Well, for Andy\'s buds at the store, it sure is. Although they think he\'s a bit of an oddball, there\'s certainly a planet full of stranger (and homelier) guys who\'ve at least had one go at having a go. They consider it their duty to help Andy out of his dire situation and go to great lengths to help him. But nothing proves effective enough to lure their friend out of lifelong chastity until he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), a 40-year-old mother of three. Andy\'s friends are psyched by the possibility that \"it\" may finally happen...until they hear that Andy and Trish have begun their relationship based on a mutual no-sex policy.\r\n-\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nThe stock supervisor of Smart Tech store Andy is a nice guy and good colleague. One night, his colleagues David, Jay and Cal invite him for a poker game, and in the end of the night, they find that Andy is a 40-year-old virgin and they decide to help him to score. When he meets the divorced Trish, the owner of \"We Sell Your Stuff on eBay\" store, they agree to have no sex before their 20th date. Andy gets into many troubles due to these situations.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-07-28 04:14:14','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::K-16/13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::18+\r\nIreland::16\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMalta::16\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',12),(357,'0478311','Knocked Up','Knocked Up','Knocked Up\r\nLigeramente embarazada\r\nEn cloque, mode d\'emploi\r\nLigeiramente Grávidos\r\nПозабременяла\r\nGrossesse surprise\r\nZalomilo se\r\nKõht ette\r\nPaksuna\r\nBeim ersten Mal\r\nMe tin proti\r\nΜε την πρώτη\r\nFelkoppintva\r\nपेट से\r\nMolto incinta\r\n無ケーカクの命中男　ノックトアップ\r\nPēkšņi stāvoklī\r\nUžkibo\r\nWpadka\r\nUm Azar do Caraças\r\nUn pic însarcinata\r\nНемножко беременна\r\nZaglavilo se\r\nNapumpana\r\nLío embarazoso\r\nPå smällen\r\n好孕臨門\r\nKaza kurşunu\r\nТрішки вагітна\r\nUntitled Judd Apatow Project',2007,129,6.9,363013,'English','United States','Comedy\r\nRomance','Judd Apatow','Judd Apatow','Judd Apatow\r\nEvan Goldberg\r\nShauna Robertson\r\nSeth Rogen\r\nClayton Townsend','Joe Henry\r\nLoudon Wainwright III','Seth Rogen\r\nKatherine Heigl\r\nPaul Rudd\r\nLeslie Mann\r\nJason Segel\r\nJay Baruchel\r\nJonah Hill\r\nMartin Starr\r\nCharlyne Yi\r\nIris Apatow\r\nMaude Apatow\r\nJoanna Kerns\r\nHarold Ramis\r\nAlan Tudyk\r\nKristen Wiig\r\nBill Hader\r\nKen Jeong\r\nCraig Robinson\r\nTim Bagley\r\nLoudon Wainwright III\r\nStephanie Mnookin\r\nAdam Scott\r\nJ.P.

Television, she goes to a night-club to celebrate with her older married sister Debbie. Alison meets the pothead reckless Ben Stone and while having a small talk with Ben, Debbie\'s husband Pete calls her to tell that their daughter has chicken pox. Debbie leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand. Ben does not use a condom and eight weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant. She calls Ben and they decide to try to stay together and have the baby. However, Ben needs to grow up first to raise a family of his own.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nBen Stone, like his four roommates, is a schlub and slacker. Their sole work - unpaid self-employment - is creating a website that identifies where scenes of women\'s nudity appears in mainstream movies. Alison Scott lives in a suite in the house of Debbie and Pete, her sister and brother-in-law. Slightly insecure Alison masks that insecurity by trying to control her life, much like her sister. Alison celebrates her promotion as on-air reporter for E! by going out with Debbie to a club, where she meets Ben. A generous gesture on Ben\'s part leads to Ben and Alison hooking up, which by the sober light of day she realizes was probably a mistake as they are totally incompatible. Conversely, Ben really likes Alison, who generally would be considered out of his league. However, that liaison results in Alison becoming pregnant. After thinking about the implications, she decides to keep the baby. Beyond the personal issues, Alison struggles with how this pregnancy will affect her new job, especially in the eyes of her image conscious bosses, Jack and Jill. Despite being a big kid himself, Ben, wanting to do right by Alison, supports her in any way he can. As they are both \"nice\" people who strive for the traditional when it comes to family, they decide to give their relationship a shot despite their incompatibility. Especially for Alison, her primary concern is not ending up the way of Debbie and Pete, who too are incompatible, who only married because Debbie got pregnant, and who both seem unhappy in their married life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-07-28 04:15:46','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::Not Rated',18),(358,'8267604','Capernaum','Capernaum','Capharnaüm\r\nCafarnaúm: La ciudad olvidada\r\nCapernaum - Stadt der Hoffung\r\nCafarnaum\r\nКапернаум\r\nCapernaum\r\n何以为家\r\nCafarnaúm-La ciudad olvidada\r\nKafarnaum\r\nKapernaum\r\nKapernaum - kaaoksen lapset\r\nCapernaum: Stadt der Hoffnung\r\nΚαπερναούμ\r\nKafarnaum: A remény útja\r\nCafarnao - Caos e miracoli\r\nSonzai no nai kodomo-tachi\r\n存在のない子供たち\r\nCafarnaúm\r\nKafarnaumas\r\nCafarnaúm: la ciudad olvidada\r\nCapernaum - Haos și speranță\r\n我想有個家\r\nKefernahum\r\nChaos\r\nCapharnaum',2018,126,8.4,81467,'Arabic\r\nAmharic','Lebanon\r\nFrance\r\nCyprus\r\nQatar\r\nUnited Kingdom','Drama','Nadine Labaki','Nadine Labaki\r\nJihad Hojeily\r\nMichelle Keserwany\r\nGeorges Khabbaz\r\nKhaled Mouzanar','Candice Abela-Mikati\r\nRay Barakat\r\nJoslyn Barnes\r\nAssaad Debs\r\nChrystel Elias\r\nDanny Glover\r\nMarianne Katra\r\nAntoine Khalife\r\nJason Kliot\r\nChady Eli Mattar\r\nKateryna Merkt\r\nMichel Merkt\r\nFouad Mikati\r\nKhaled Mouzanar\r\nAyla Rizk\r\nSamer Rizk\r\nSusan Rockefeller\r\nAkram Safa\r\nGeorges Sarraf\r\nPierre Sarraf\r\nWissam Smayra\r\nSylvio Sharif Tabet\r\nAnne-Dominique Toussaint\r\nJoana Vicente','Khaled Mouzanar','Zain Al Rafeea\r\nYordanos Shiferaw\r\nBoluwatife Treasure Bankole\r\nKawsar Al Haddad\r\nFadi Yousef\r\nCedra Izzam\r\nAlaa Chouchnieh\r\nElias Khoury\r\nMohammad Al Abdallah\r\nMohamad Abdellatif\r\nAbdo Abdo\r\nHampig Abraham\r\nJamil Ahmad\r\nMohamad Akkar\r\nElias Akobegia\r\nRiman Al Rafeea\r\nLegamett Alamou\r\nMajd Nabil Alhalabi\r\nNabil Hasan Ali\r\nWissam Al Ali\r\nFatme Aliammal\r\nKhodr Ali Alkhalaf\r\nFaten Asmar\r\nAhmad Assaf\r\nMohamad Assaf\r\nRosina Awtar\r\nRoula Awtar\r\nShahinour Awtar\r\nRima Awter\r\nElean Badrawi\r\nRinalyn Balderamos\r\nMerlita Bayo\r\nYemisrach Begasham\r\nLama Begaum\r\nMinara Begaum\r\nFe Blanco\r\nAnas Breij\r\nMohamad Chabouri\r\nDarine Chahine\r\nSamira Chalhoub\r\nMohamad Chbib\r\nLouais Dandan\r\nMohamad Darwich\r\nNasser Darwich\r\nZakaria Darwich\r\nJasmine Delore\r\nAhmad El Beiruty\r\nMohamad El Beiruty\r\nMohamad El Hallak\r\nNour El Husseini\r\nAbdellatif El Joghlob\r\nSaid El Nachar\r\nAsmaa El Razek\r\nRahaf El Razek\r\nAhmad Fahim\r\nAhmad Fakhreddine\r\nHayat Fakhredine\r\nShaden Fakih\r\nBarraa\' Fares\r\nGroupe Franciscain\r\nHussein Ghaddar\r\nAhmad Ghadi\r\nMirna Ghamloushi\r\nJamil Ghosh\r\nMaryam Chamoun Haddad\r\nAbdallah Hajjar\r\nMohammad Hammoud\r\nFarah Hasno\r\nSamir Zaki Hussein\r\nTamer Ibrahim\r\nMirna Izzam\r\nBahia Jaber\r\nTaha Jaber\r\nSami Al Jamal\r\nMurad Jawapra\r\nJoseph Jimbazian\r\nAbdelsalam Kamal\r\nFarah Kanjo\r\nFadi Kassem\r\nMahmoud Kassem\r\nAwedis Kerdejian\r\nKevork Kevorkian\r\nNadine Labaki\r\nJoe Maalouf\r\nMary Jane Magracia\r\nGhida Majzoub\r\nTespina George Megalides\r\nGrace Mikhael\r\nKemet Nado Mongesho\r\nAli Mordaa\r\nMichel Moukarzel\r\nNajat Amar Moussa\r\nHassan Nassar\r\nAhmad Obeid\r\nChadi Obeid\r\nHassan Ben Qaiss\r\nFoutoun Raad\r\nAbbas Raafat\r\nHussein Al Rafeea\r\nIman Al Rafeea\r\nSaleh Ramadan\r\nSerena Safa\r\nZeinab Safwan\r\nMona Saliba\r\nSoeur Helene Seif\r\nAhmad Shabana\r\nHirot Solomon\r\nMichele Suedad\r\nMostafa Taabani\r\nMohamad Tayeh\r\nHaymourot Teshome\r\nRenelyn A.

The film follows Zain as he journeys from gutsy, streetwise child to hardened 12-year-old \"adult\" fleeing his negligent parents, surviving through his wits on the streets, where he meets Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil, who provides him with shelter and food, as Zain takes care of her baby son Yonas in return. Zain later gets jailed for committing a violent crime, and finally seeks justice in a courtroom.\r\n\r\nWith his family grappling with extreme poverty, forever indebted to their ruthless landlord, the sad twelve-year-old boy, Zain, is forced to fend for himself in the squalid and overcrowded slums of Beirut. Unable to save his eleven-year-old sister, Sahar, from an uneasy arrangement, Zain will soon find himself all alone in a faceless city, ending up at a small amusement park to befriend another lost soul: the Ethiopian cleaner and mother of one, Rahil. But, in this grim and hostile world, there is no room for dreamers--and as a horrifying discovery is the last straw--a rabid desire for retribution possesses Zain and his blood-thirsty knife demands justice.

Nancy must think quickly, as Fred tries to pick them off one by one. When he has you in your sleep, who is there to save you?\r\n-\r\nsimon_hrdng\r\n\r\nNancy is having nightmares about a frightening, badly-scarred figure who wears a glove with razor-sharp \"finger knives\". She soon discovers that her friends are having similar dreams. When the kids begin to die, Nancy realizes that she must stay awake to survive. Uncovering the secret identity of the dream killer and his connection with the children of Elm Street, the girl plots to draw him out into the real world.\r\n-\r\nDavid Thiel\r\n\r\nIn the early 1980\'s, a psychopath named Fred Krueger - known as the Springwood Slasher - murdered several children with a glove outfitted with straight razor blades attached to the fingers. When a foolish decision by a judge sets Krueger free, an angry mob of parents, whose children he terrorized and murdered, burn Kruger alive in the boiler room where he worked. Years after his death, the living children of the parents responsible for Krueger\'s death (including Nancy Thompson, daughter of the police officer who arrested Krueger) experience terrifying nightmares involving a burned man wearing a glove with razor blades on the fingers. The ghost of Fred Krueger haunts their dreams, and when Nancy\'s best friend Tina dies violently in her sleep during a dream confrontation with Krueger, Nancy realizes she must find a way to stop the evil psychopath\'s reign of terror - or never sleep again.\r\n-\r\nDerek O\'Cain\r\n\r\nFred Kruger is the substance of nightmares. He always appears strangely dressed and has knives on the fingers of his right hand. A group of four teenagers all begin to have the same strange dreams about Fred before one of them is gruesomely murdered in her sleep. The survivors soon realize that if Fred kills them in their sleep, then they will die in real life too. Thus begins an ordeal of wakefulness as they try to find some way to stop Fred.\r\n-\r\nGoth\r\n\r\nNancy and her friends suffer violent nightmares which all feature one common element, a disfigured serial killer with a glove made of razors on his right hand. When one of the group is murdered while asleep, Nancy realizes that she must stay awake and try to uncover the truth behind this phantasmic killer Fred Krueger.\r\n-\r\nAction Dan','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-01 10:31:47','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::14A\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM18\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nMalta::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::RP16\r\nNorway::18\r\nPeru::18\r\nPhilippines::R-18\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/18\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::TV-14\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+\r\nWest Germany::18',12),(364,'0312004','Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit','Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit','The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\r\nWallace y Gromit - La batalla de los vegetales\r\nWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\r\nWallace & Gromit - Auf der Jagd nach dem Riesenkaninchen\r\nWallace & Gromit - Le mystère du lapin-garou\r\nWallace & Gromit: A Batalha dos Vegetais\r\nУолъс и Громит: Проклятието на заека\r\nWallace et Gromit: Le Mystère du lapin-garou\r\nWallace y Gromit: La Batalla de Los Vegetales\r\nWallace i Gromit u velikoj povrtnoj zavjeri\r\nWallace & Gromit - Prokletí králíkodlaka\r\nWalter & Trofast - det store grøntsagskup\r\nWalter og Trofast - Det store grøntsagskup\r\nWallace ja Gromit: Libaküüliku needus\r\nWallace & Gromit: Kanin kirous\r\nWallace & Gromit - kanin kirous\r\nWallace & Gromit: Varulvskaninens förbannelse\r\nWallace et Gromit - Le mystère du lapin-garou\r\nWallace & Gromit ston terastio lahanokipo\r\nΓουάλας και Γκρόμιτ στον τεράστιο λαχανόκηπο\r\nSuper Invincible Dog Leader in Big Lying Rabbit of the Century\r\nWallace és Gromit és az elvetemült veteménylény\r\nWallace & Gromit: Nefrine Hayoolaye Khargooshnama\r\nWallace & Gromit - La maledizione del coniglio mannaro\r\nウォレスとグルミット　野菜畑で大ピンチ！\r\nVoless un Gromits.

Suddenly, a huge, mysterious, veg-ravaging \"beast\" begins attacking the town\'s sacred vegetable plots at night, and the competition hostess, Lady Tottington, commissions Anti-Pesto to catch it and save the day. Lying in wait, however, is Lady Tottington\'s snobby suitor, Victor Quartermaine, who\'d rather shoot the beast and secure the position of local hero-not to mention Lady Tottingon\'s hand in marriage. With the fate of the competition in the balance, Lady Tottington is eventually forced to allow Victor to hunt down the vegetable chomping marauder. Little does she know that Victor\'s real intent could have dire consequences for her ...and our two heroes.\r\n-\r\nDreamWorks SKG\r\n\r\nThe plucky characters from a series of animated shorts, Wallace and his dog, Gromit, make their feature debut here. After starting a pest control business, the duo soon lands a job from the alluring Lady Tottington to stop a giant rabbit from destroying the town\'s crops. Both Wallace and the stuffy Victor vie for the lady\'s affections. If Wallace wants to please his pretty client, and best Victor, he needs to capture that pesky bunny.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nWallace, the ingenious, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal sidekick, the proud co-founders of the humane pest control agency, Anti-Pesto, are the only ones standing between the townspeople\'s vegetables and the swarms of furry, hungry bunnies. However, with just four days to go until Tottington Hall\'s annual Giant Vegetable Competition, hosted by Lady Tottington, vague rumours of a menacing, nightmarish creature raiding vegetable patches throughout the countryside chill the bone to the marrow. Now, to win fair Lady Tottington\'s heart, the intrepid duo must put their expertise to good use to apprehend the beast before the trigger-happy suitor, Victor Quartermaine, and his vicious bulldog, Philip, get the chance to find the freak first. Can Wallace and Gromit stop the monster and lift the curse of the fiendish were-rabbit?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nWallace and his dog, Gromit has built up a very respectable business which prevents any pests from destructing the vegetables of the village, but when a creature, only described as the were-rabbit, rampages through the village, all eyes are on Wallace. After hearing his plan, the villagers are on his side, expect one man. Victor Quartermaine feels threatened by Wallace\'s relationship with his fiancée Lady Campanula Tottington and aims to take out the bunny himself.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUk','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-04 06:01:25','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nBulgaria::A\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nCzechia::U\r\nDenmark::7\r\nFinland::K-3\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nGreece::K\r\nHong Kong::I\r\nIceland::L\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::G\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::V\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::AA\r\nNetherlands::MG6\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::7\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPortugal::M/6\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::All\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nUnited Kingdom::U\r\nUnited States::G\r\nVietnam::P',0),(363,'0425112','Hot Fuzz','Hot Fuzz','Hot Fuzz\r\nArma fatal\r\nChumbo Grosso\r\nГорещи палки\r\nSuper flic\r\n热血警探\r\nSuper Policias\r\nEksplozivni murjaci\r\nJednotka prílis rychlého nasazení\r\nValusad võmmid\r\nHot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis\r\nHot Fuzz - Verbrechen verboten\r\nKaftoi kai asfairoi\r\nΚαυτοί και Άσφαιροι\r\nVaskabátok\r\nホット・ファズ　俺たちスーパーポリスメン！\r\nKrutie kruķi\r\nKietas faras\r\nHot Fuzz: Super policías\r\nHot Fuzz.

Too good. To stop the rest of his team looking bad, he is reassigned to the quiet town of Sandford. He is paired with Danny Butterman, who endlessly questions him on the action lifestyle. Everything seems quiet for Angel until two actors are found decapitated. It is called an accident, but Angel won\'t accept that, especially when more and more people turn up dead. Angel and Danny clash with everyone while they try to uncover the truth behind the mystery of the apparent \"accidents\".\r\n-\r\nFilm_Fan\r\n\r\nInstead of appreciating his extraordinary arrest record, faithful and impeccable service to the country, and set of formidable skills, the superiors of the exemplary officer of the London Metropolitan Police, PC Nicholas Angel, \"promote\" him to the sleepy town of Sandford. There, like a fish out of water, Angel must get used to an entirely different reality, and for the first time in a long while, learn how to relax as the partner of the local police chief\'s overzealous son Danny. However, against the backdrop of an uneventful service, a sudden spate of grisly accidents will jolt Nick into action, leading him to believe that there\'s more to the seemingly tranquil and picture-perfect community than meets the eye. Now, a sinister conspiracy threatens Sandford\'s peace. Will Danny finally get to see action after all?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nNicholas Angel is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force. He\'s so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel\'s superiors send him to a place where his talents won\'t be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy, seemingly-crime-free village of Sandford. Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman. The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman, Danny is a huge action-movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life \"bad boy\" and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so craves. Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny\'s puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel\'s growing frustration. However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny\'s dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It\'s time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.\r\n-\r\nRogue Pictures\r\n\r\nSgt. Nicholas Angel is just about the perfect copper: honest, reliable, and dedicated to public duty. The only problem is that he is too good. His arrest record is so good that he is making everyone else look bad so he suddenly finds himself transferred to the picturesque village of Sandford. There he not only finds that the police force is less than ideal, but that there is in fact very little policing to do. The odd drunk and a few lads with a can of spray paint are about all there is to worry about. He becomes friendly with Constable Danny Butterman, who just happens to be the station chief\'s son.

She gains the help of Rick O\'Connell, after saving him from his death. What Evelyn, her brother Jonathan and Rick are unaware of is that another group of explorers are interested in the same dig. Unfortunately for everyone, this group ends up unleashing a curse which been laid on the dead High Priest Imhotep.

Nearly three millenniums later, in 1926, the intrepid American adventurer, Rick O\'Connell, the bookish British Egyptologist, Evelyn, and her brother, Jonathan, unwisely embark on a dangerous treasure hunt in the lost city of Hamunaptra, only to inadvertently set free Imhotep. Now, the slowly regenerating creature plans his revenge, hell-bent on unleashing ten devastating plagues upon Egypt, and, above all, reunite with his eternal lover, Anck-Su-Namun.

However, when the group accidentally brings Imhotep back to life, the results are fatal.\r\n-\r\nEmma B.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt, high priest Imhotep started a forbidden relationship with Anck Su Namun, Pharaoh Seti\'s Mistress. When Seti finds out about what\'s going on, Imhotep and his loved one stab him, but can\'t escape the trustworthy guards: Anck Su Namun chooses to commit suicide while Imhotep is bestowed with the Hom-Dai, the most feared curse of all: He is mummified alive in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead. More than thirty-six centuries later, in 1923, to be exact, adventurer Rick leads Egyptologist Evelyn and her brother Jonathan to mysterious Hamunaptra. While Jonathan is keen on finding the legendary Egyptian treasures, Evelyn wants to search for the Book of the Living, which would clarify a lot in historical knowledge about the ancient Egyptians. Unfortunately, they and a rivaling group of careless American adventurers free Imhotep\'s mummy from his eternal prison. Now, with the ancient and quite agile high priest on the loose, the adventurers and scientists face not only a dangerous enemy, but also a massive threat to today\'s world: Imhotep wants to bring Anck Su Namun back to life by using Evelyn\'s body, but he also wants to rid the world of the disbelieving crowd of democracy-supporters to be able to enforce his tyrannic dictatorship.\r\n-\r\nJulian Reischl','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-15 05:27:59','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBelgium::KT/EA\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::14A\r\nCzechia::U\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::0+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::Not Rated\r\nUkraine::12\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(367,'0360717','King Kong','King Kong','King Kong\r\nКинг Конг\r\nΚινγκ Κονγκ\r\nकिंग काँग\r\nキング・コング\r\nKing Kongas\r\n金剛\r\nКінг Конг\r\nPeter Jackson\'s King Kong\r\nKong: The Eighth Wonder of the World',2005,187,7.2,412470,'English','United States\r\nNew Zealand\r\nGermany','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nDrama\r\nRomance','Peter Jackson','Fran Walsh\r\nPhilippa Boyens\r\nPeter Jackson\r\nMerian C.

Instead--aboard a weather-beaten tramp steamer, along with the respected playwright, Jack Driscoll--the unsuspecting crew find themselves at the back of beyond, in the impenetrable jungles of the obscure Skull Island: the home of ferocious primaeval relics, and the mysterious land of Kong, the all-powerful eight-metre-tall silverback gorilla.

Once there, they discover that King Kong is a real creature, living in a massive jungle where creatures from prehistoric times have been protected and hidden for millions of years. As the explorers search for the great ape, their quest puts them up against both Kong and his dinosaur enemies. Ultimately, it is the attention of a beautiful human woman that soothes Kong long enough for him to be subdued by the explorers and shipped back to New York, where his bleak future involves being put on display in front of humans... but how long can even the mightiest shackles of man hold back an ape 25 feet tall?\r\n-\r\nbondish','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-15 05:28:24','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics avec avertissement\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+',12),(368,'1899353','The Raid: Redemption','Raid: Redemption','Serbuan maut\r\nLa redada\r\nThe Raid\r\nOperação Invasão\r\nОперацията: Изкупление\r\nThe Raid: Redemption\r\nLa Redada\r\n突袭\r\nRacija: Iskupljenje\r\nZátah\r\nZátah: Vykoupení\r\nHaarang\r\nLe commando\r\nΕπιχείρηση: Χάος\r\nA rajtaütés\r\nSerbuan Maut\r\nThe Deadly Raid\r\nThe Raid - Redenzione\r\nザ・レイド\r\nZa Reido\r\nReidas: atpirkimas\r\nRaid\r\nNalot\r\nРейд\r\nРација: Искупљење\r\nRedada asesina\r\nThe Raid - Uppgörelsen\r\n全面突襲\r\nBaskın\r\nРейд: Спокута\r\nReyd\r\nĐột kích: Chuộc tội',2011,101,7.6,199759,'Indonesian','Indonesia\r\nFrance\r\nUnited States','Action\r\nCrime\r\nThriller','Gareth Evans','Gareth Evans','Rangga Maya Barack-Evans\r\nNate Bolotin\r\nTodd Brown\r\nIrwan D.

Church doesn\'t tell him what he is getting. And Church sends a woman, Maggie with him to make sure he gets it. They find the plane and get the thing but some men take one of Barney\'s people hostage and the leader tells him to give him what they got or he\'ll kill his hostage. They give it to him but he kills his hostage anyway. Barney asks Maggie what was so important about that thing. She says that it showed the location of a Russian plutonium storage mine.

Church sends the specialist Maggie to go with them. Soon they find the plane and Maggie takes a box from the safe, but while returning to the plane, they find that their sniper Billy The Kid (Liam Hemsworth) has been captured by a group of men under the command of Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme). He asks them to put the weapons on the ground and deliver him the box; otherwise, he would kill the hostage. Barney and his group do exactly what was ordered but Villain kills Billy the Kid before leaving in a helicopter. Barney asks Maggie what was inside the box and she tells that it shows the location of a large mine of Russian plutonium. Now Barney and his men decide to track down Villain and his group known as The Sangs and kill them.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nThe Expendables return with a vengeance in this follow-up to the 2010 surprise hit. Con Air\'s Simon West directed from a script by Sylvester Stallone and David Agosto. This time, Barney Ross (Stallone) and his merry band of mercenaries (including Jason Statham, Randy Couture, Dolph Lundgren, and Terry Crews) take on a mission from Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to clear Ross\' record. The mission in question involves acquiring a black box from a downed airplane, with the caveat that they bring along Maggie (Yu Nan), a military-trained soldier who throws a gendered wrench into the team\'s manly ranks. When another mercenary, Jean Vilain (Jean Claude Van Damme), ambushes the team and mess up their newest member (The Hunger Games\' Liam Hemsworth), it\'s hunt and kill time for the Expendables. Jet Li returns in an extended cameo, as does Arnold Schwarzenegger, with fellow \'80s action star Chuck Norris coming along for the ride.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nThe Expendables are reunited when Mr. Church enlists them to take on a seemingly simple job. When things go wrong, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory, where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time - five tons of weapons-grade plutonium, more than enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that\'s nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary they seek revenge from.\r\n-\r\nLionsgate','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-19 16:06:25','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::16\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16D',18),(370,'2333784','The Expendables 3','Expendables 3','The Expendables 3\r\nLos indestructibles 3\r\nMeghlubedilmezler 3\r\nOs Mercenários 3\r\nНепобедимите 3\r\nLes sacrifiés 3\r\nPlaćenici 3\r\nExpendables: Postradatelní 3\r\nPalgasõdurid 3\r\nExpendables 3\r\nGasaghebulebi 3\r\nThe Expendables 3: A Man\'s Job\r\nOi analosimoi 3\r\nΟι αναλώσιμοι 3\r\nThe Expendables - A feláldozhatók 3.\r\nBilty nishkakhim 3\r\nI mercenari 3\r\nエクスペンダブルズ3 ワールドミッション\r\nNeiznīcināmie 3\r\nNesunaikinami 3\r\nNiezniszczalni 3\r\nEroi de sacrificiu 3\r\nНеудержимые 3\r\nПлаћеници 3\r\nPlacanci 3\r\nLos mercenarios 3\r\n浴血任務3\r\nCehennem Melekleri 3\r\nНестримні 3\r\nThe Expendables III\r\nChegarasiz 3\r\nLos Indestructibles 3\r\nBiệt Đội Đánh Thuê 3',2014,126,6.1,178202,'English\r\nRomanian\r\nSpanish','France\r\nGermany\r\nBulgaria\r\nUnited States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nThriller','Patrick Hughes','Sylvester Stallone\r\nCreighton Rothenberger\r\nKatrin Benedikt\r\nSylvester Stallone\r\nDave Callaham','Guy Avshalom\r\nGuymon Casady\r\nJohn Constantine\r\nBoaz Davidson\r\nRobert Earl\r\nJon Feltheimer\r\nSamuel Hadida\r\nVictor Hadida\r\nBasil Iwanyk\r\nZygi Kamasa\r\nEda Kowan\r\nAvi Lerner\r\nDanny Lerner\r\nLonnie Ramati\r\nTrevor Short\r\nKevin King Templeton\r\nJohn Thompson\r\nLes Weldon','Brian Tyler','Sylvester Stallone\r\nJason Statham\r\nHarrison Ford\r\nArnold Schwarzenegger\r\nMel Gibson\r\nWesley Snipes\r\nDolph Lundgren\r\nRandy Couture\r\nTerry Crews\r\nKelsey Grammer\r\nGlen Powell\r\nAntonio Banderas\r\nVictor Ortiz\r\nRonda Rousey\r\nKellan Lutz\r\nJet Li\r\nIvan Kostadinov\r\nRobert Davi\r\nNikolay Stoyanov Ilchev\r\nDaniel Angelov\r\nSlavi Slavov\r\nDimiter Doichinov\r\nNikolay Stanoev\r\nHarry Anichkin\r\nBoswell Maloka\r\nNatalie Burn\r\nVelizar Binev\r\nSarai Givaty\r\nLiubomir Simeonov\r\nFrank Pesce\r\nThomas Canestraro\r\nAleksandar Belovski\r\nAleksandra Bogdanska\r\nLilia Doytchinova\r\nIvaylo Grancharov\r\nWendy Kay\r\nCyndy Powell\r\nBashar Rahal\r\nTzvetislav Samardjiev','New team.

Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarries and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn\'t expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she\'s ever met. He\'s nothing like anyone she\'s ever met, period. He\'s intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn\'t like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn\'t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he\'s immortal. That\'s right - vampire. But he doesn\'t have fangs - that\'s just in the movies. And he doesn\'t drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them Edward must fight to save Bella? A modern, visual, and visceral Romeo and Juliet story of the ultimate forbidden love affair - between vampire and mortal.\r\n-\r\nSummit Entertainment\r\n\r\nWhen Bella moves to the rainy, cold and cloudy town of Forks to live with her dad, she doesn\'t expect much. She\'s kind of a misfit and doesn\'t have a lot of friends. But when she meets the extremely mysterious and handsome looking boy, Edward Cullen everything changes. As the two slowly grow closer, Bella stumbles upon Edward\'s most deadly secret and they begin to realize they have a very strong love for one another. Edward has been waiting for a long time for a soul mate and Bella is the one. But the closer he gets to her the more difficult it becomes for him to resist her blood. The two know they are entering a forbidden relationship and that they have to face many dangers just because they are together. Will Bella trust her heart or the warning signs going through her head?\r\n\r\nWithout expectations, the mature high school student, Bella Swan, relocates to the rain-soaked town of Forks to live with her father, after her divorced mother decides to remarry. However--as life is as exciting as it is unpredictable--the taciturn newcomer has a life-altering encounter with her withdrawn and morosely beautiful classmate, Edward Cullen, who, right from the start, senses the intoxicating effects of a dangerously suppressed feeling gnawing at him. Now--harbouring the deep and dark secret of vampiric immortality--Edward\'s insatiable thirst for warm blood stands in the way of experiencing a much nobler, and yet unfulfilled feeling. Little by little, as shocking revelations pave the way for an all-consuming whirlwind romance, innocent Bella\'s mortal flesh yearns for the palpable wonders of immortal love; even if her unquenched desire may lead her to her demise. Is this unconventional union nothing but a dream, or is this the prelude to an unending young passion?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIsabella Swan moves to gloomy Forks to live with her father.

Edward warns Bella that she should leave him but she refuses to listen and to understand why he is saying this. Bella learns his secret. He is a vampire, however she is not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and the fact he could kill her at any moment. Bella is afraid of losing him, the love of her life. The thrill begins when a new vampire finds it a challenge to hunt Bella down for her irresistible blood. The game is on and James will not stop until she is killed.\r\n-\r\ncourtney\r\n\r\nBella Swan was not expecting anything out of the ordinary to happen when she moved to live with her Dad in Forks, Washington. But this where her life truly begins. There she meets Edward Cullen, a mysterious and captivating student at her new high school. Bella soon discovers that Edward is hiding a secret, after he impossibly saves her life with his super-human strength and speed. She is determined to unravel his secret, but the truth is more terrifying than she realized. Edward is a vampire. Any normal person would just keep away from him, but Edward and Bella have fallen passionately and unconditionally in love with each other.

The catastrophic nightmare is depicted through the eyes of one American family fighting for survival.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary man has to protect his children against alien invaders in this science fiction action film freely adapted from the classic story by H.G. Wells. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a dockworker living in New Jersey, divorced from his first wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and estranged from his two children Rachel and Robbie (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin), of whom he has custody on weekends. On one such visitation, looking after the kids becomes a little more difficult when, after a series of strange lighting storms hit his neighborhood, Ray discovers that a fleet of death-ray robotic spaceships have emerged nearby, part of the first wave of an all-out alien invasion of the Earth. Transporting his children from New York to Boston in an attempt to find safety at Mary Ann\'s parents\' house, Ray must learn to become the protector and provider he never was in marriage.\r\n\r\nSadly, the hard-working and disillusioned New Jersey dockworker, Ray Ferrier, has failed as a husband, and as a father. Estranged from his troubled teenage son, Robbie, and his little daughter, Rachel, Ray struggles to build bridges with his kids, as his ex-wife, Mary Ann, drops them off at his house for the weekend. But, pretty soon, things will get from bad to worse, when, out of the blue, mysterious electromagnetic pulses and violent sets of lightning flashes start hammering the area, and a full-scale, all-out invasion of a technologically-advanced alien species wreaks havoc on a completely defenceless Earth. Now, Ray must find a way to protect his family, as they all try to reunite with Mary Ann; however, can a single man and a mere mortal alone outsmart the legions of pitiless intergalactic invaders?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nRay Ferrier (Cruise) is a divorced dockworker and less-than-perfect father. When his ex-wife and her new husband drop off his teenage son Robbie and young daughter Rachel for a rare weekend visit, a strange and powerful lightning storm suddenly touches down. What follows is the extraordinary battle for the future of humankind through the eyes of one American family fighting to survive it in this contemporary retelling of H.G. Wells seminal classic sci-fi actioner.\r\n-\r\nMajorwest','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-19 16:49:16','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::14+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::16+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+',12),(373,'0816711','World War Z','World War Z','World War Z\r\nGuerra mundial Z\r\nDünya Müharibesi Z\r\nSvjetski rat Z\r\nGuerra Mundial Z\r\nZ-та световна война\r\nSvětová válka Z\r\nZ maailmasõda\r\nPagosmios Polemos Z\r\nΠαγκόσμιος πόλεμος Ζ\r\nZ világháború\r\nMilhemet ha\'olam Z\r\nWârudo Wô Z\r\nワールド・ウォー Z\r\nPasaules karš Z\r\nPasaulinis karas Z\r\nWWZ: Guerra Mundial\r\nZiua Z: Apocalipsa\r\nZiua Z: Apocalipsa 3D\r\nВойна миров Z\r\nМировая война Z\r\nСветски рат Z\r\nSvetová vojna Z\r\nSvetovna vojna Z\r\n末日之戰\r\nDünya Savaşı Z\r\nВсесвітня війна Z\r\nJahon urushi Z\r\nThế Chiến Z',2013,116,7,639291,'English\r\nSpanish\r\nHebrew\r\nArabic','United States\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nMalta','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nHorror\r\nSci-Fi','Marc Forster','Matthew Michael Carnahan\r\nDrew Goddard\r\nDamon Lindelof\r\nMatthew Michael Carnahan\r\nJ.

Suddenly, the world is plagued by a mysterious infection turning whole human populations into rampaging mindless zombies. After barely escaping the chaos, Lane is persuaded to go on a mission to investigate this disease. What follows is a perilous trek around the world where Lane must brave horrific dangers and long odds to find answers before human civilization falls.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nWhen former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane and his family get stuck in urban gridlock, he senses that it\'s no ordinary traffic jam. His suspicions are confirmed when, suddenly, the city erupts into chaos. A lethal virus, spread through a single bite, is turning healthy people into something vicious, unthinking and feral. As the pandemic threatens to consume humanity, Gerry leads a worldwide search to find the source of the infection and, with luck, a halt to it\'s spread.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nA virulent and unprecedented pandemic of global proportions which turns humans into rabid flesh-eating zombies takes the world by surprise. Under these circumstances, the retired United Nations special agent, Gerry Lane, must leave behind a peaceful family life, a wife and two daughters, to escort a team of scientists on a mission to find a cure, navigating through zombie-swarmed cities. However, as the deadly pathogen obliterates entire areas, incessantly giving birth to diseased masses of freshly-reanimated undead, the frail hope of finding a viable solution starts drifting away. Does humanity have enough time to wait for a miracle?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nHaving retired as U.N. investigator, Gerry Lane devotes his time to wife Karin and their wining brat daughter Constance and Rachel in Philadelphia, until it becomes the next site of a globally spreading mystery epidemic turning bitten people into rabies-like zombies. His clueless former chief, deputy secretary general Thierry Umutoni, recalls him to the UN emergency team, thus offering the whole family a spot aboard the safe air carrier. Gerry joins though army veterans on reconnaissance to Korea, where a rogue CIA agent\'s suggestion proves worthless, then to Israel, where a Mossad \'contrarious tenth man\' had the foresight to respond to a vague Indian pandemic threat by erecting a wall Jerusalem, only to see an undead flood overtake it. His last minute escape flight must deal drastically with an infected passenger before crashing in Cardiff, near a WHO research facility, where he combines and tests a daring out of the box \'camouflage\' strategy inspired by weir observations.\r\n-\r\nKGF Vissers\r\n\r\nRetired U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and his family are sitting in what appears to be a typical Philadelphia traffic jam when helicopters began to circle ominously overhead and an explosion throws the city into panic. In the blink of an eye, the streets are consumed by chaos. When Gerry learns that the catalyst for the turmoil is a highly contagious virus that transforms those who contract it into rampaging maniacs and that legions of the infected are growing on all continents, he agrees to join his former colleagues in discovering the source of the rampant plague so that his wife and two daughters will be guaranteed safety aboard a UN fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. Upon tracing a crucial e-mail to a U.S. military base in South Korea, Gerry learns that the infection has spread more rapidly than anyone realizes. Although a subsequent trip to Jerusalem, where the government has constructed a massive wall to keep the public safe, initially offers hope that the growing horde can be kept at bay, an unexpected breach sends Gerry back into the sky in search of patient zero. Just when Gerry thinks he\'s traced the origins of the virus, however, the unthinkable happens. Subsequently stranded in Cardiff with a fearless Israeli soldier, Gerry quickly makes his way to a World Health Organization outpost where the few remaining scientists have hit a dead end in their search for a cure. But the struggle is far from over and after recalling an unusual scene witnessed in Jerusalem, Gerry prepares to make a leap of faith that could prevent the downfall of humanity..','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-19 16:53:47','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::(Banned)\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R-18\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::12A\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG12\r\nSingapore::NC-16\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(374,'1467304','The Human Centipede (First Sequence)','Human Centipede (First Sequence)','The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\r\nA Centopéia Humana\r\nЧовешка стоножка\r\nThe Human Centipede - First Sequence\r\nLjudska stonoga\r\nThe Human Centipede\r\nHuman Centipede - Der menschliche Tausendfüßler\r\nムカデ人間\r\nCilveku Simtkajis\r\nŽmogaus šimtakojis\r\nEl engendro del mal\r\nLudzka stonoga\r\nA Centopeia Humana\r\nSiamezii\r\nЧeловеческая многоножка\r\nЉудска стонога\r\nThe human centipede (First sequence)',2009,92,4.4,77268,'English\r\nGerman\r\nJapanese','Netherlands','Horror','Tom Six','Tom Six','Ilona Six\r\nTom Six','Patrick Savage\r\nHoleg Spies','Dieter Laser\r\nAshley C.

In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob -- knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella is confronted with the most important decision of her life.\r\n-\r\nSummit Entertainment\r\n\r\nIsabella Swan was a normal teenage girl, in a normal world. Until she met Edward Cullen and Jacob Black. Since then she has been up against a Sadistic Vampire, The Volturi and an angry werewolf, Paul. But what lies ahead is something only Edward\'s \'brother\', Jasper Hale, can help the Cullens with, who have a secret on their side. With Graduation coming fast, Bella gets more and more worried about becoming immortal. But the real question is: Who will she choose?\r\n-\r\nJemma From England\r\n\r\nWith the long-awaited high-school graduation day just around the corner, Bella--more than ever--must find the courage to grapple with her confronting feelings for the lethally charming Edward, and the ferociously handsome Jacob, after her short-term breakup in The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009). Now, against the backdrop of a brutish killing spree in Seattle and a fierce rivalry between clans, a vengeful and relentless adversary amasses an invincible army of immortals, hell-bent on revenge. Once more, passion demands a sacrifice--and as an honourable but frail pact timidly forms in the name of love--the gallant suitors must set aside their vast differences to defend Bella. Indeed, this is an impossible love triangle; however, in the aftermath of desire, will the mortal enemies accept Bella\'s tough decision?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nBella and Edward have been reunited, but their forbidden relationship is threatened to be torn apart again with an evil vampire still seeking her revenge. And Bella is forced to choose between her true love for Edward or her friendship with Jacob Black as the struggles between vampires and werewolves continues.

And happy to see her daughter, Renesmee is flourishing. But when someone sees Renesmee do something that makes them think that she was turned. This person goes to the Volturi, because it is a violation to turn a child. And the penalty is death for both who turned the child into a vampire and the child, cause they deem a turned child too dangerous. Alice gets a vision of the Volturi coming after them. So the Cullens try to convince them that Renesmee is not a threat. So they ask friends and family to come stand with them. But when someone who has it in for the Volturi shows up and tells them they should be ready for a fight. And they get ready.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nBella trains her new abilities with Edward Cullen and they are happy to see their daughter Renesmee growing very fast. Jacob Black has an imprint with the child, irritating Bella. Volturi believes that the girls is a threat to the vampires and decide to travel to Forks to kill Renesmee and her parents. Alice Cullen has a premonition with the Volturi coming to Forks and Edward and Bella visit other clans to convince them to protect Renesmee from the Volturi together with Jacob\'s pack. The battlefield is ready for a bloody fight.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nNow a full vampire, Bella begins to enjoy a new life with her husband Edward and newborn daughter Renesmee. And Jacob Black vows to be her guardian since he imprinted on Renesmee. However, their new lives together are cut short when someone thinks that Renesmee is an immortal child, which is a violation of law. And danger rises when the sinister Volturi declare the child dangerous and plot to dispose of the Cullens. So the Cullens move to make one final stand. To make this work, they must rally friends and family to stand with them in a final battle that will not only decide the child\'s fate, but the fate of Bella, Edward and their family.\r\n-\r\nBlazer346\r\n\r\nWith eyes as scarlet as a raging fire and an unquenched lust for warm fresh blood, vampire-Bella gets a new lease of life, after the agonising near-death experience in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (2011). Suddenly, everything is new--and as the blissful parents, Edward and Bella, are so proud of their exceptional baby-girl, Renesmee--once more, an insidious and equally remorseless menace in the shape of the all-powerful coven of the Volturi threatens the House of Cullens. Now, a terrible war is brewing, unless Jacob\'s pack of ferocious wolves, the ancient clan of Forks\' vampires, and their loyal undead supporters stand against the scheming leader of the Volturi, Aro, and his evil forces. Will they emerge unscathed? Above all, will Edward and Bella stay forever young, forever beautiful, and forever in love?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nBella is enjoying her new life and new powers, after the birth of their daughter, Renesmee. Soon, however, their family bliss is threatened again, by a new menace. Bella and the Cullens - together with any allies they can assemble - are preparing to fight a crucial, ultimate battle, to protect their family.\r\n-\r\nImLibSkyFe','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-21 06:25:43','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nCzechia::12\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nGreece::K-12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::16\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::16+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMaldives::15+\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::C16',12),(379,'0232500','The Fast and the Furious','Fast and the Furious','The Fast and the Furious\r\nRápido y furioso\r\nVelozes e Furiosos\r\nVelozes & Furiosos\r\nБързи и яростни\r\nRapides et dangereux\r\nFast & Furious\r\n速度与激情\r\nBrzi i žestoki\r\nRychle a zběsile\r\nKiired ja vihased\r\nHurjapäät\r\nVåghalsarna\r\nFast and Furious\r\nOi mahites ton dromon\r\nΟι μαχητές των δρόμων\r\nHalálos iramban\r\nSari\' va khashen\r\nWild Speed\r\nワイルド・スピード\r\nĀtrs un bez žēlastības\r\nGreiti ir isiutę\r\nSzybcy i wściekli\r\nVelocidade Furiosa\r\nFurios si iute\r\nФорсаж\r\nPaklene ulice\r\nRýchlo a zbesilo\r\nHitri in drzni\r\nA todo gas\r\nThe Fast and the Furious (A todo gas)\r\n玩命關頭\r\nHızlı ve Öfkeli\r\nRacer X\r\nRedline\r\nStreet Wars\r\nForsaj\r\nQuá Nhanh Quá Nguy Hiểm',2001,106,6.8,373710,'English\r\nSpanish','United States\r\nGermany','Action\r\nCrime\r\nThriller','Rob Cohen','Ken Li\r\nGary Scott Thompson\r\nGary Scott Thompson\r\nErik Bergquist\r\nDavid Ayer','Creighton Bellinger\r\nDoug Claybourne\r\nWayne Johnson\r\nNeal H.

The only way he can pay off the debt of his loss is to venture into the deadly realm of the Tokyo underworld, where the stakes are life and death.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-21 06:45:26','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::14\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::14\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::SPG\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUkraine::16\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(382,'1013752','Fast & Furious','Fast & Furious','Fast & Furious\r\nRápidos y furiosos\r\nFast and Furious\r\nVelozes e Furiosos 4\r\nVelozes & Furiosos 4\r\nБърз и яростен\r\nRapides et dangereux\r\n速度与激情4\r\nBrzi i žestoki 4\r\nRychlí a zběsilí\r\nFast & Furious 4\r\nKiired ja vihased - Uus mudel\r\nKiired ja vihased 4\r\nHurjapäät 4\r\nFast & Furious - Neues Modell.

Sensing Raldo is a loan shark, Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando\'s re-worked car against Raldo\'s, and wagering his own show car. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his show car. The next day, Dom is approached by the elusive terrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron), who coerces him into working for her. Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), are recruited by Diplomatic Security Service (D.S.S.) Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) to help him retrieve an E.M.P. device from a military outpost in Berlin, Germany.

By the sixth grade, in 1961, Bryce tries to get rid of Juli by dating Sherry Stalls, whom Juli despises. However, Bryce\'s best friend, Garrett, takes an interest in Sherry and eventually tells her the truth about Bryce asking her out; she doesn\'t take it well. From Juli\'s perspective, Bryce returned her feelings, but was shy. After finding out Bryce and Sherry broke up, she thought she could have Bryce back. But then they reconsider their decisions as time goes on. In 1962, Bryce\'s grandfather Chet Duncan moves in with the family. Chet has different views about Juli. There\'s a large, old sycamore tree that Juli loves which no one else understands. One day, it\'s cut down by a group of landscapers so a house can be built there, despite Juli\'s opposition. She becomes very depressed afterwards, as the tree let her see the world in a more enlightened way. Her father gives her a painting of the tree.\r\n\r\n1963. The Loskis and the Bakers have lived across the street from each other since 1957 when the Loskis moved into the neighborhood. They, as families, have never spent any time together socially in the differences especially between the family patriarchs, judgmental Steven Loski who has always viewed the Bakers as beneath him especially since they won\'t even maintain their yard, while free-spirited Richard Baker has other priorities in life with the family\'s limited funds to worry too much about what Steven thinks. Juli Baker, now in the eighth grade, has had a crush on classmate Bryce Loski ever since the Loskis were unloading their moving truck when she and Bryce were in the second grade, and Juli looked deep into Bryce\'s eyes. Bryce, however, has done whatever he felt he needed to do to avoid who he considered overbearing and thus annoying Juli. Bryce\'s maternal grandfather, Chet Duncan, who recently moved in with the Loskis, sees Juli in a different vein, she the rare soul that is a beacon of light, much like his now deceased wife. Several events in Bryce and Juli\'s lives are shown this year - seen individually from Bryce and Juli\'s very different perspectives - that may change the tide in their relationship, the ups and downs which are also affected by external forces combined with the strength or weakness within each of Bryce and Juli.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nJuli Baker devoutly believes in three things: the sanctity of trees (especially her beloved sycamore), the wholesomeness of the eggs she collects from her backyard flock of chickens, and that someday she will kiss Bryce Loski. Ever since she saw Bryce\'s dazzling brown eyes back in second grade, Juli has been smitten. Unfortunately, Bryce has never felt the same. Frankly, he thinks Juli Baker is a little weird--after all, what kind of freak raises chickens and sits in trees for fun? Then, in eighth grade, everything changes. Bryce begins to see that Juli\'s unusual interests and pride in her family are, well, kind of cool. And Juli starts to think that maybe Bryce\'s dazzling brown eyes are as empty as the rest of Bryce seems to be. After all, what kind of jerk doesn\'t care about other people\'s feelings about chickens and trees? With Flipped, mystery author Wendelin Van Draanen has taken a break from her Sammy Keyes series, and the result is flipping fantastic. Bryce and Juli\'s rants and raves about each other ring so true that teen readers will quickly identify with at least one of these hilarious feuding egos, if not both. A perfect introduction to the adolescent war between the sexes.\r\n-\r\nanonymous','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-22 02:19:37','','','','','',0,0,0,'Australia::PG\r\nBrazil::Livre\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous Public\r\nGermany::0\r\nGreece::K-8\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::13+\r\nPoland::16\r\nRussia::6+\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::TP\r\nSweden::7\r\nTurkey::7A\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG',7),(391,'2452386','The Fundamentals of Caring','Fundamentals of Caring','The Fundamentals of Caring\r\nLos principios del cuidado\r\nAmizades Improváveis\r\nUmweg nach Hause\r\nΟι Βασικές Αρχές της Φροντίδας\r\nHogyan gondozd felebarátodat\r\nAltruisti si diventa\r\n思いやりのススメ\r\nOpiekun\r\nОсновные принципы добра\r\nOsnovi negovanja\r\nĐiều Căn Bản Của Việc Quan Tâm',2016,97,7.3,69556,'English','United States','Comedy\r\nDrama','Rob Burnett','Rob Burnett\r\nJonathan Evison','Rob Burnett\r\nJamal Daniel\r\nDonna Gigliotti\r\nJames Spies\r\nRenee Witt','Ryan Miller','Alex Huff\r\nDonna Biscoe\r\nPaul Rudd\r\nJulia Denton\r\nJennifer Ehle\r\nCraig Roberts\r\nAshley White\r\nMatthew Pruitt\r\nAlan Boell\r\nSelena Gomez\r\nBill Murphey\r\nRobert Walker Branchaud\r\nEric Singer\r\nJames Donadio\r\nMegan Ferguson\r\nSamantha Huskey\r\nFrederick Weller\r\nMatt Mercurio\r\nVictor Garibay\r\nSam Lazarus\r\nBobby Cannavale\r\nCassie\r\nTarik Chernet\r\nLori Hammel\r\nWalter Hendrix III\r\nPolly Mitchell Giles\r\nPatti Schellhaas\r\nBlake Sewell','Caring is a funny thing.','A man suffering a family loss enrolls in a class about care-giving that changes his perspective on life.','A man suffering a family loss enrolls in a class about care-giving that changes his perspective on life.\r\n\r\nA writer (Paul Rudd) retires after a personal tragedy and becomes a disabled teen\'s caregiver.

Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl\'s ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy\'s tech savvy and Martin\'s enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nMiami-born Carl Casper is the head chef of Gauloise in Brentwood, California. While popular with his kitchen staff and hostess Molly, the restaurant owner Riva wants Carl to stick to \"classics\" rather than innovative dishes. Carl has a strained relationship with his tech-savvy preteen son Percy and rich ex-wife Inez. When Carl has the chance to serve prestigious critic and blogger Ramsey Michel, Riva demands he stick with old favorites at the last minute; Carl concedes, leading to a scathing review. On Twitter, Carl insults Ramsey for the review, not realizing that his reply is public, and gains a large Twitter following. Carl comes up with a new menu that his staff loves and invites Ramsey to a \"rematch\"; however, he quits after confronting Riva, who wants the old menu again..\r\n\r\nLos Angeles-based executive chef Carl Casper was once deemed the one to watch within the business. But years working for Riva at upscale Gauloise, Riva who promised him creative control but who has ended up dictating that he cater the menu and his cooking to the tastes of the masses, Carl has lost that promise, although his staff, including his sous chef Tony, the sommelier Molly, but especially one of the line cooks Martin, still admire his talent. Carl may not realize how much this stifling has affected his psyche, that negativity which led to the dissolution of his marriage to Inez, and he having a strained relationship with his and Inez\'s ten year old son Percy, who only wants to spend quality time with his physically present but mentally absent father in their mandated time together. In being a social media newbie, Carl ends up having a very public breakdown. In the aftermath, Carl, with nothing else he wants to do but be a chef, has to reinvent himself in some manner to get back on his feet. He decides to take Inez up a long standing offer concerning her first husband, Miami-based entrepreneur Marvin who has a hygiene fetish. Despite not fully trusting Marvin, Carl may rediscover his passion for cooking and in the process his passion for life in general, that passion which may bring those things of importance that he has lost in the ten years back.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nCarl Casper is a disillusioned chef fed up with his restaurant\'s management, poor reviews and lack of creativity. After an online battle with a well-known critic leads to further frustration, Carl decides to leave and go solo as a food truck operator in a bid to rediscover his flair for cooking.','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-22 02:44:38','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::8\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::S\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::6\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::6\r\nIndia::A\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::8\r\nTurkey::7+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',18),(393,'0804497','It\'s Kind of a Funny Story','It\'s Kind of a Funny Story','It\'s Kind of a Funny Story\r\nUna divertida historia\r\nSe Enlouquecer, Não se Apaixone\r\nНещо като забавна история\r\nВсъщност е забавна история\r\nC\'est comme une drôle d\'histoire\r\nNěco jako komedie\r\nUne drôle d\'histoire\r\nIt\'s Kind of a Funny Story - Eine echt verrückte Story\r\nMia parea, ligo... koukou\r\nΜια παρέα, λίγο... κούκου\r\nNyomás alatt\r\n5 giorni fuori\r\nなんだかおかしな物語\r\nCałkiem zabawna historia\r\nÉ Uma Espécie de...

With the help of his best friend, his mother, and a young therapist at the cancer center, Adam learns what and who the most important things in his life are.\r\n-\r\nCalikeane\r\n\r\nAdam is a methodical twenty-seven year old writer of radio programs that lives together with his girlfriend Rachael that is a painter. His best friend is Kyle that does not like Rachael and Adam is estranged of his overprotective mother Diane, who takes care of her husband Richard that has Alzheimer. When Adam feels a pain on his back, he goes to the doctor and is diagnosed of spinal cancer. He researches in Internet and he sees that his odds are 50% of healing. He goes to chemotherapy and is helped by the twenty-four year-old therapist Katherine. Along the treatment, Adam finds more about the feelings of Rachael, Katherine and Kyle and he realizes how much his mother loves him.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAdam is 27, working for public radio in Seattle. He consults a doctor about his back pains and gets a terrible diagnosis - a rare form of cancer that\'s fatal half the time. Chemo starts immediately. His best friend Kyle, and his girlfriend, Rachael, vow to see him through it. Rachael helps keep his dramatic mother at bay, he meets some of the regulars at chemo, and he\'s assigned a grad-student psychologist, Katherine: he\'s her third patient, and she tries to say the right things, often without effect. Kyle wants to turn Adam\'s cancer into a chick magnet, Rachael keeps Adam at arm\'s length, Adam doesn\'t answer his mom\'s calls, and the chemo saps his strength. The clock ticks.\r\n-\r\n\r\nDespite leading an extremely healthy lifestyle, which includes no smoking, no drinking, no drugs and not even possessing a driver\'s license to partake in what he considers the associated dangerous activity, twenty-seven year old Seattle Public Radio journalist Adam Lerner is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. After getting over the initial shock of the diagnosis upon which he could not focus after the word \"cancer\", Adam reads online about his specific type - schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma - the article he reads which reports a 50% survival rate. His primary physician, Dr. Ross, prescribes a course of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before they can even contemplate the dangerous surgery to remove the remainder of the malignant growth which is located on his spine. Beyond the variety of emotions Adam goes through related to his diagnosis and his treatment, he also goes through a range of emotions in relation to the help and support provided by the various people in his life. They include: Diane Lerner, his overbearing mother who he believes has become even more overbearing with this news, especially as her life is spent solely dealing with Adam\'s father\'s Alzheimer\'s; Rachael, his girlfriend, who had to decide whether to stay with him as they were just at point of taking their relationship to that next level or calling it quits when Adam was first diagnosed; Kyle, his SPR colleague and best friend, who tries to cheer Adam up by the positive, mostly in that Adam can get laid by anyone he wants by playing the sympathy card (and in turn Kyle can get his fair share riding on Adam\'s coattails); Alan Lombardo and Mitch Barnett, two older fellow chemo patients who become the human faces of cancer to Adam; and Katherine McKay, a twenty-four year old Ph.D. candidate who is assigned his psychological therapist, he who is only her third such patient which shows in her sometimes awkward but well meaning textbook actions.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nWritten by Will Reiser who based the film on his own experiences fighting cancer, Jonathan Levine\'s poignant comedy 50/50 stars Joseph Gordonn-Levitt as Adam, a 27-year-old public-radio employee who discovers he has cancer. As his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to help out, his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) proves to be a less than ideal life partner for this particular crisis. All the while, Adam\'s overprotective mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) tries to overcome her son\'s continued attempts to keep her out of his life. As Adam begins to discover how hard it is to deal with his situation, and to maintain various relationships in his life, he begins seeing a young counselor (Anna Kendrick) who might prove to be just as helpful personally as she is professionally.','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-22 02:47:02','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE\r\nFinland::K-11\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIndia::18\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::PG12\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNorway::11\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSweden::7\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R',0),(395,'0208092','Snatch','Snatch','Snatch\r\nSnatch: Cerdos y diamantes\r\nSnatch - Schweine und Diamanten\r\nSnatch: Porcos e Diamantes\r\nГепи\r\nSnatch: Tu braques ou tu raques\r\n偷拐抢骗\r\nCerdos y diamantes\r\nZdrpi i briši\r\nPodfu(c)k\r\nTeemandirööv\r\nSnatch - Hävyttömät\r\nSnatch - Tu braques ou tu raques\r\nSnatch: Schweine und Diamanten\r\nI arpahti\r\nΗ αρπαχτή\r\nBlöff\r\nGhap-zani\r\nSnatch - Lo strappo\r\nスナッチ\r\nĶēriens\r\nVagišiai\r\nPrzekręt\r\nSnatch - Porcos E Diamantes\r\nUnde dai și unde crapă\r\nБольшой куш\r\nСтырили\r\nСнеч\r\nСнеч: Свиње и дијаманти\r\nPodfuk\r\nPljuni in jo stisni\r\nSnatch, cerdos y diamantes\r\n偷拐搶騙\r\nKapışma\r\nВеликий куш\r\nLock, Stock... and Six Stolen Diamonds\r\nDiamonds\r\nSnatch\'d\r\nThe Guy Ritchie Project',2000,102,8.2,827134,'English\r\nRussian','United Kingdom\r\nUnited States','Comedy\r\nCrime','Guy Ritchie','Guy Ritchie','Michael Dreyer\r\nStephen Marks\r\nPeter Morton\r\nAngad Paul\r\nSebastian Pearson\r\nTaha Ali Reza\r\nTrudie Styler\r\nSteve Tisch\r\nMatthew Vaughn','John Murphy','Ade\r\nWilliam Beck\r\nAndy Beckwith\r\nEwen Bremner\r\nJason Buckham\r\nMickey Cantwell\r\nNicola Collins\r\nTeena Collins\r\nCharles Cork\r\nJames Cunningham\r\nSorcha Cusack\r\nMickey Dee\r\nBenicio Del Toro\r\nSam Douglas\r\nDennis Farina\r\nJason Flemyng\r\nAdam Fogerty\r\nAlan Ford\r\nRobbie Gee\r\nGoldie\r\nStephen Graham\r\nSid Hoare\r\nRonald Isaac\r\nLennie James\r\nVinnie Jones\r\nChuck Julian\r\nDave Legeno\r\nEric Meyers\r\nJason Ninh Cao\r\nPaul O\'Boyle\r\nBrad Pitt\r\nMike Reid\r\nJimmy Roussounis\r\nSidney Sedin\r\nRade Serbedzija\r\nJason Statham\r\nTrevor Steedman\r\nYuri Stepanov\r\nPeter Szakacs\r\nJohn Taheny\r\nMick Theo\r\nAndy Till\r\nVelibor Topic\r\nScott Welch\r\nMichael Hughes\r\nLiam McMahon\r\nJames Warren\r\nAustin Drage\r\nLiam Donaghy\r\nJoe Williams\r\nJohn Farnell\r\nShaun Pearson\r\nDean Smith\r\nRoy Snell\r\nTim Faraday\r\nAndrew Shield\r\nAlex Andreas\r\nDian Bachar\r\nDean Batchelor\r\nMatthew Burlem\r\nSol Campbell\r\nElwin \'Chopper\' David\r\nTom Delmar\r\nChristopher Fosh\r\nJohn Hathaway\r\nStanley McBean\r\nArnold Montey\r\nTim Packham\r\nGuy Ritchie\r\nPeter Rnic\r\nAndy Skinner\r\nKriss Sprules\r\nTony Tang','Stealin\' Stones and Breakin\' Bones\r\n\r\nNow you see it, now you don\'t!\r\n\r\nStealing stones is hazardous.','Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.','Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.\r\n\r\nTurkish and his close friend/accomplice Tommy get pulled into the world of match fixing by the notorious Brick Top.

Injecting some much needed energy into their repertoire, The Bellas take on their male rivals in a campus competition.\r\n\r\nThe Barden Bellas are a collegiate, all-girls a cappella singing group thriving on female pop songs and their perfect looks. After a disastrous failing at last year\'s finals, they are forced to regroup. Among the new recruits is freshman Beca, an independent, aspiring DJ with no interest in the college life. But after she meets Jesse, from the rival all-male a cappella group, Beca has a new outlook and takes it upon herself to help the Bellas find their new look and sound and get back into the competition.\r\n-\r\nnapierslogs\r\n\r\nBarden College sports four different a cappella singing groups, the all-male Treblemakers and the all-female Bellas, who are the most antagonistic toward each other of the four, making it into the national finals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAC), held annually at Lincoln Center in New York City. The Bellas are the first all-female group to make the finals, but what strides they make forward for all women singing take two major steps backward at the finals with tired, uninspired arrangements solely of twentieth century girl songs, and an unfortunate incident by their controlling lead, Aubrey Posen, whose choice of singers has to be clones of her pretty self. As such, Aubrey and co-lead Chloe Beale have to rebuild the group from scratch for the upcoming season, which will be difficult due to the notoriety from the incident at the finals. Meanwhile, Beca Mitchell is a reluctant freshman at Barden, her Barden professor father paying for her tuition for one year just so that she can be exposed to college life. Her reluctance is that she is a loner, she preferring to work on her music mixes in solitude in her want to be a Los Angeles DJ or music producer. Although she is made aware of the Bellas in her wanderings around campus, Beca has no intention of auditioning, until she meets Chloe, who encourages her to do so. Beca is accepted with a more diverse group than has ever been the Bellas, but Beca and Aubrey end up clashing over Aubrey\'s direction for the group, which she mistakenly believes is the winning direction. One of Aubrey\'s other zero tolerance policies is no sex with any Treblemaker. Although Beca has no intention of breaking that policy, she does admit that one of the few people on campus she has befriended beyond the other women in the Bellas is fellow music lover and singer Jesse Swanson, an aspiring film score composer and a freshman Treblemaker. Beca will have to decide how far to break out of her shell and stay true to her own musical leanings, which if she does so means taking on Aubrey for some control of the group. What Beca decides may also affect what happens in her friendship with Jesse.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nA feisty coed joins a collegiate a Capella group and upgrades their song selection for the 21st century during the run-up to a major competition in this melodic comedy from Tony-nominated Avenue Q director Jason Moore. Drifting past the various cliques after arriving at college, Beca (Anna Kendrick) pays more attention to the jams pumping in her headphones than the people she passes on her way to class. But all that changes the moment she stumbles into the one place where every misfit has a voice -- the campus a Capella group. Although the competition among st the singers proves surprisingly fierce, there\'s just one aspect of the group Beca can\'t wrap her head around: All of the songs they perform are at least a decade old. Convinced that they can do better by adding some contemporary tunes into the mix, Beca whips up an exciting new set list that will set the group apart and leave their rivals in the dust.','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-22 02:48:46','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::PG\r\nDenmark::A\r\nFinland::K-7\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIndonesia::13+\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+',0),(397,'2584384','Jojo Rabbit','Jojo Rabbit','Jojo Rabbit\r\nДжоджо Заека\r\nJojo\r\n乔乔的异想世界\r\nKrálíček Jojo\r\nJänespüks Jojo\r\nΤζότζο\r\n陽光兔仔兵\r\nJojo Nyuszi\r\nジョジョ・ラビット\r\nTrusis Džodžo\r\nZuikis Džodžo\r\nКролик Джоджо\r\nЗец Џоџо\r\nKráliček Jojo\r\nZajec Jojo\r\n兔嘲男孩\r\nTai Noi Jojo\r\nTavşan Jojo\r\nQuyonyurak Jojo',2019,108,7.9,357250,'English\r\nGerman','New Zealand\r\nCzech Republic\r\nUnited States','Comedy\r\nDrama\r\nWar','Taika Waititi','Christine Leunens\r\nTaika Waititi','T.K.

Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.\r\n-\r\nFox Searchlight Pictures\r\n\r\n1944 Germany. Ten year old Johannes Betzler, more commonly called Jojo, is the son of good Germans, his father away fighting in Italy, while he is under the care of his mother Rosie, with his older sister Inge recently having passed away from illness. With only one true friend in the form of same aged, bespectacled Yorki, Jojo, in wanting to fit in, is arguably entering what he would consider the most important phase of his young life in attending a Nazi youth camp presided over by Captain Klenzendorf, Captain K\'s almost too faithful assistant Freddy Finkel, and Fräulein Rahm, who takes Nazi policies in a slightly off-kilter direction. Despite being considered an outsider by most of the other youth in town, Jojo figures he has a leg up on everyone else at camp in that he is constantly being guided by the spirit of Der Führer himself, Adolf Hitler, whose personal bodyguard Jojo aspires to be when he grows up. In his general day-to-day life but also supported by his time at camp, Jojo has a hatred for Jewish people despite not really knowing anything about them or ever having met anyone of the Jewish faith, the ultimate goal to kill them. So when Jojo meets someone Jewish for the first time, especially as that meeting is in what is for him the most unlikely of circumstances, Jojo has to figure out what to do. While truly believing he is a Nazi despite not really knowing what that means, he has to decide either to follow what he has been taught in hating and trying to kill any Jewish person despite knowing that killing is not in his true nature, or not, which may have larger consequences with relation to family. While he decides, he truly gets to know the person beyond the label of \"Jewish\" which may factor into what happens.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn the waning months of the Third Reich, the unpopular ten-year-old German boy, Johannes \"Jojo\" Betzler, can\'t wait to join the ranks of the Nazi Party\'s youth organisation, during an intense training weekend that guarantees to separate the men from the boys. Massively into swastikas and ready to give up his life for his megalomaniac idol, Adolf Hitler, instead, the Führer\'s tiny number one fan gets kicked out of the Hitler Youth after a disastrous first assignment in front of his peers--an ignominious defeat that earns Jojo an equally degrading nickname. Now, with nothing but time on his hands, Johannes is in for a rude awakening when he accidentally unearths his progressive mother\'s well-hidden secret and comes face-to-face with a shocking new reality so much different from the hypnotic indoctrinations he\'s absorbed. But, does everything happen for a reason? Are the others always the enemy? In a mad world, devoured by fear and prejudice, is youthful innocence humankind\'s redemption?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-22 02:50:18','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nAustria::12\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::PG\r\nChile::14\r\nColombia::12\r\nCzechia::U\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::12\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-12\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::12\r\nVietnam::C13',12),(398,'1057500','Invictus','Invictus','Invictus\r\nНесломим\r\nNeporazený\r\nInvictus - oövervinnlig\r\nInvictus - Voittamaton\r\nInvictus - Unbezwungen\r\nAnikitos\r\nΑνίκητος\r\nInvictus - A legyőzhetetlen\r\nInvictus - L\'invincibile\r\nインビクタス　負けざる者たち\r\nNenugalimas\r\nInvictus - de uovervinnelige\r\nInvictus - Niepokonany\r\nNeinfrant\r\nНепокоренный\r\nНепобедиви\r\nNepremagljiv\r\nInvictus - De oövervinneliga\r\n打不倒的勇者\r\nYenilmez\r\nНепідкорений\r\nThe Human Factor\r\nBất Khuất',2009,134,7.3,156689,'English\r\nAfrikaans\r\nMaori\r\nZulu\r\nXhosa\r\nSotho','United States','Biography\r\nDrama\r\nHistory\r\nSport','Clint Eastwood','Anthony Peckham\r\nJohn Carlin','Gary Barber\r\nRoger Birnbaum\r\nClint Eastwood\r\nMorgan Freeman\r\nGenevieve Hofmeyr\r\nRobert Lorenz\r\nLori McCreary\r\nTim Moore\r\nMace Neufeld','Kyle Eastwood\r\nMichael Stevens','Morgan Freeman\r\nMatt Damon\r\nTony Kgoroge\r\nPatrick Mofokeng\r\nMatt Stern\r\nJulian Lewis Jones\r\nAdjoa Andoh\r\nMarguerite Wheatley\r\nLeleti Khumalo\r\nPatrick Lyster\r\nPenny Downie\r\nSibongile Nojila\r\nBonnie Mbuli\r\nShakes Myeko\r\nLouis Minnaar\r\nDanny Keogh\r\nDan Robbertse\r\nRobin Smith\r\nDavid Dukas\r\nGrant Swanby\r\nJosias Moleele\r\nLangley Kirkwood\r\nRobert Hobbs\r\nMelusi Yeni\r\nVuyo Dabula\r\nDaniel Hadebe\r\nJodi Botha\r\nHennie Bosman\r\nRefiloe Mpakanyane\r\nJakkie Groenewald\r\nMurray Todd\r\nJapan Mthembu\r\nAlbert Maritz\r\nSello Motloung\r\nMeren Reddy\r\nLida Botha\r\nSusan Danford\r\nSylvia Mngxekeza\r\nJames Lithgow\r\nMalusi Skenjana\r\nBart Fouche\r\nJohnny Cicco\r\nWayne Harrison\r\nAshley Taylor\r\nGift Leotlela\r\nKgosi Mongake\r\nGiven Stuurman\r\nVuyolwethu Stevens\r\nAyabulela Stevens\r\nNambitha Mpumlwana\r\nAndre Jacobs\r\nJ.R.

Newly-elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially and economically divided in the wake of Apartheid. Believing he can bring his people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela rallies South Africa\'s rugby team as they make their run to the 1995 Rugby World Cup Championship match.\r\n-\r\nalfiehitchie\r\n\r\nNelson Mandela\'s (Morgan Freeman) release from prison and his ascent to a democratically-elected President of South Africa marks a radical change in the country. This change away from Apartheid will not be easy for anyone in the country, but Mandela must figure out how to galvanize the residents of the country together. Because of his love of the game, Mandela places his support behind the Springboks, the national rugby team. South Africa is hosting the 1995 Rugby World Cup, that being the only reason the Springboks are even competing in the tournament as its years on the sideline of world rugby events has not made it world ranked. The Springboks were previously considered the team of white South Africa, and as such was denounced by Mandela when he was in prison. But he does whatever he can to make it the team of all South Africa. He needs the support of the Springboks and its Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to achieve his unrealistic goal of the Springboks winning the World Cup, even against such rugby powerhouses the All-Blacks representing New Zealand. Mandela tries to inspire Pienaar to lead by example, much like Mandela has. Beyond Mandela\'s dream, his racially mixed security team has the added pressure of protecting him at the Springboks\' matches while he places himself in potentially unprotectable situations.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nAfter being elected President, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) seeks to bring his divided country together. But it won\'t be easy because some still resent the presence of the Afrikaaners who oppressed them. They want to get rid of all symbols of their oppression--including the National Rugby team, the Springboks, which for many is a major symbol of their oppression. But Mandela chooses to stand up for them. With the World Cup approaching, Mandela sends for the team Captain, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), and he subtly tells him that he wants them to win the World Cup.

Not knowing what to expect on his mission to shed light on his opaque past, grizzled Noodles reunites with his only living friend Fat Moe after 35 haunted years of self-exile. However, the relentless, piercing sound of culpability stands in the way of finding closure, as the inscrutable content of a well-worn leather suitcase further complicates matters. And now, against the backdrop of a torn conscience, the sad, bittersweet recollections of more than 50 years of love, death, and everything in-between become inextricably intertwined, leading to even more puzzling questions. But what are a man\'s options when he is left with nothing?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nEpic, episodic tale of the lives of a small group of New York City Jewish gangsters spanning over 40 years.

After graduating from Harvard, Bryan might have had his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley (Larson.) One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx,) who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie.

The train accidentally gets stopped because of a small avalanche. Little did he know that a murder was planned and that a person on this train was capable of committing such crime.\r\n-\r\nDoomRanger\r\n\r\nHaving just solved a mysterious theft in Jerusalem, the famed Belgian moustachioed detective, Hercule Poirot, is in need of balancing things in his life with a small vacation, in 1934 Istanbul. Instead, the vigilant detective will soon find himself aboard the luxurious Orient Express on a trip to Calais, sharing a carriage with an eclectic assortment of first-class travellers and an invisible murderer who walks unnoticed among them. When a sudden massive avalanche blocks the tracks--trapping the passengers in the locomotive--the gruesome murder of a commuter in his cabin will force Poirot to solve a conundrum where everyone is a suspect. Who is the killer?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nFamed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is travelling on the Orient Express when a murder is committed. The victim was a particularly obnoxious man with a criminal past. As clues are revealed, it is apparent that many of the other passengers on the train had a motive to kill him, making Poirot\'s task of identifying the murderer much more difficult.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nIn 1934, famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot solves a theft at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The obsessive-compulsive sleuth, who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amidst truth to be a curse, wants to rest in Istanbul, but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, nephew of the director of the Simplon-route Orient Express service, arranges a bunk for him aboard the train. Unscrupulous businessman Edward Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett\'s compartment, and later sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train\'s engine, stranding the passengers.\r\n\r\nIt\'s the winter of 1934. Eccentric yet famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, in the Middle East on a part business, part pleasure trip, is able to secure passage at the last minute in First Class on the Orient Express from Istanbul to Paris, despite First Class being sold out, odd for this time of year. The securing of the cabin is a favor from his friend Bouc, who works for the railroad, he the nephew of one of the railroad\'s executives. Poirot\'s last minute change of plan is as he is notified of a case for which he has to return to London immediately. He is initially to share a cabin with Hector MacQueen, the assistant to American businessman, Edward Ratchett. Aboard, Poirot rejects Ratchett\'s offer of employment for the duration of the trip to act as his security as Ratchett believes someone is trying to kill him, he admitting that his business dealings less than above board. Despite not wanting to get involved, Poirot cannot refuse Bouc\'s request - when Ratchett is discovered murdered, stabbed twelve times in his cabin, while the train is temporarily snowbound in the Yugoslav mountains - to investigate until the Yugoslav police arrive to take over, if only to protect the most vulnerable on board. From initial evidence, Poirot deduces that the murderer has to be among the dozen or so people who are traveling or working on the Calais First Class car. In his investigation, Poirot discovers that Ratchett, an assumed name, was once involved in a child kidnapping case in the States, a case with which Poirot is intimately familiar. As such, Ratchett\'s murder could be associated to that incident rather than his crooked business dealings.

When Jimmy\'s teen daughter Katie dies, Sean investigates, Dave\'s a suspect, and Jimmy vows to find the killer before the cops.

But what he really wants Blomkvist to do is to find out what happened to his niece, who went missing 40 years ago. Blomkvist, at first, is not interested, till the man offers to help him clear his name. Blomkvist, begins by talking to the man\'s relatives who were there when the girl went missing. And some of them are not forth coming. Blomkvist eventually believes that her disappearance might have something to do with some serial killings that took place 20 years before she disappeared. So he asks for a research assistant. So the industrialist\'s man suggests Lisbeth Salander, a talented hacker who does background checks for them and who even did one on Blomkvist. When he sees her report, he\'s impressed and asks her to work with him and she does. She\'s anti-social but is extremely efficient.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nAfter being successfully sued for libel by a wealthy industrialist, investigative journalist Mikael Blomqvist leaves his magazine Millennium and accepts an offer from Henrik Vanger to write the Vanger family history. An old industrial family, the Vangers have their share of skeletons in their closet. What Henrik is most interested in learning however is what happened to his niece, Harriet Vanger, who he is certain was murdered by a member of his family in the summer of 1966. Mikael takes on the task and moves into a small cottage on the Vanger estate. He begins to decipher some of the clues Harriet has left behind and decides to get an assistant, computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, the woman who did the very thorough background check on him for Vanger. Together, they learn of some of the Vangers deep, violent secrets.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nStockholm-based Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner and co-editor of Millennium magazine, has just lost a high profile libel case resulting from an article he wrote on businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. This loss has the potential to ruin Mikael professionally. As such, he leaves the magazine in the hands of the other co-owner/co-editor, Erika Berger, with who he is openly having an affair, which ruined his marriage. Even in Erika\'s hands, the magazine is also suffering because of the scandal and resulting loss of ad revenue. Because of Mikael\'s investigative abilities as a journalist, he receives an offer by wealthy and aged Henrik Vanger: solve the forty year old cold case of his missing and presumed dead grandniece, Harriet Vanger, who was only sixteen at the time of her disappearance. Despite Henrik\'s generous financial compensation, which could also save the magazine, Mikael is unconvinced to do the work until Henrik adds one additional piece of compensation that money can\'t buy. Mikael will largely do the work on Hedeby Island just off of Hedestad in northern Sweden, the island where Harriet was last seen, and where most of the dysfunctional extended Vanger family still lives, they who are among the suspects. To the family, Mikael is solely writing a chronicle of the Vanger family, without them knowing that his primary task is to find Harriet\'s killer. As Mikael proceeds with his investigation, he asks for a research assistant. Who Henrik\'s lawyer recommends is a young woman named Lisbeth Salanger, who conducted the background check on Mikael which Henrik ordered in preparation to hire him for this job. Mikael agrees with the choice when he sees that check she did of him, he knowing that she could only have found out key pieces of information through one means, which could help in this matter. Lisbeth is a brilliant investigator, but troubled in her personal life, which includes being under state guardianship due to incidents that happened while she was growing up. Despite what he knows of Lisbeth through her research of him, and despite her alternative appearance, Mikael begins to trust her, and she him - the first person she trusts in establishment in a long time - as they tie Harriet\'s disappearance to a series of what look to be murders of young women leading up to the disappearance. Through the case, Lisbeth begins to see a different life for herself, while Mikael has the larger goal of regaining his good name by knowing that Wennerström is much what he wrote.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nFound guilty on sixteen counts of aggravated libel, the disgraced, Stockholm-based journalist of the radical Millennium magazine, Mikael Blomkvist, decides to step aside. Having all the time in the world, ruined Mikael reluctantly agrees to work for the millionaire industrialist, Henrik Vanger, who, for the past four long decades, has been trying to shed light on the mysterious disappearance of his beloved, sixteen-year-old niece, Harriet. But, as Mikael digs deep into the opaque past of the dysfunctional Vangers, under the guise of writing a memoir, he stumbles across emotionally detached Lisbeth Salander: the very same computer hacker who intruded into his personal life on Henrik\'s behalf. Now, against the backdrop of unaccountable disappearances, shocking family secrets, and a string of nauseating first-degree murders, the unlikely team must work in unison to unearth the truth.

Tris Prior makes a choice that surprises everyone. Then Tris and her fellow faction-members have to live through a highly competitive initiation process to live out the choice they have made. They must undergo extreme physical and intense psychological tests, that transform them all. But Tris has a secret that she is Divergent, which means she doesn\'t fit into any one group. If anyone knew, it would mean a certain death. As she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly peaceful society, this secret might help her save the people she loves... or it might destroy her.\r\n-\r\nanonymous\r\n\r\nIn a futuristic Chicago, society is divided into 5 factions. Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. When all teenagers reach the age of 16, they must choose to either stay in their faction of birth, or transfer into another faction. Beatrice Prior must make the decision to stay with her family in a faction she feels she isn\'t right for, or to transfer into another faction, and leave her family behind. What follows is a highly competitive initiation, where the newly renamed Tris must make some tough decisions, but she must also keep a secret that she was warned could mean death, while she juggles friends, initiation, and a newfound love interest. But there is a secret lying beneath everything that threatens to tear the city apart.\r\n-\r\nlabelma\r\n\r\nIn a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she\'s Divergent and won\'t fit in.

If she is discovered, she will be well liked.

It\'s been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. And now it\'s a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay-who not only has absolutely no memory of his time spent with the Men In Black, but is also the only living person left with the expertise to save the galaxy-to reunite with the MIB before the earth submits to ultimate destruction.\r\n-\r\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\r\n\r\nIn 1978, a race of aliens came to Earth and asked the MIB to help protect their greatest treasure which they call \"the Light\" which is a source of awesome power. But it\'s not in their mandate to do that so they tell them they can\'t and send them away. But in the present day, Serleeena an alien who wants the light comes to Earth because she suspects that the MIB did hide it. So she goes to MIB headquarters and takes it over. Zed tells J, that he has to get K who was the one who dealt with the aliens in 1978, to come back. But problem is that K\'s memory has been erased so when J tells him, he doesn\'t believe him but J eventually convinces him. So they head back so that he could be deneuralized but since Serleena took over the HQ where the deneuralizer is, they have to find another one. They eventually do and restore his memory but problem is K doesn\'t remember what happened to the light. But because of some clues K planted, they try to figure out what happened to the light.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nFive long years have passed since the retirement and neuralyzation of Agent K, and now, the mysterious death of a harmless alien calls for the help of Agent J and his unstable new partner. In the meantime--as the Kylothian shape-shifting alien, Serleena, and her double-headed minion are in search of the enigmatic Light of Zartha--inevitably, the Agency will have no other choice but to reverse K\'s neuralyzation, in high hopes of solving this baffling conundrum. However, once more, time is against them--and what is even more disheartening--the dangerously seductive Serleena is after them, using a powerless human as leverage. Will the agents manage to find the Light of Zartha and save the earth, again?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nIt has been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. Kay has since returned to the comforts of civilian life while Jay continues to work for the Men in Black, the highly funded yet unofficial government agency that regulates all things alien on earth. While investigating a seemingly routine crime, Jay uncovers a diabolical plot masterminded by Serleena, an evil Kylothian monster who disguises herself as a sexy lingerie model. It\'s a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay--who not only has no memory of his time spent with the agency, but is also the only person alive who has the expertise to save the galaxy--to reunite with the MIB before Earth is destroyed completely.\r\n-\r\nSujit R.

When he does so, Agent J (Will Smith) realizes that the timeline has been changed and he too travels back to July 15, 1969, the day before Agent K is killed. After overcoming some disbelief, J manages to convince young K and others of just who he is and why he\'s there. With the help of Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg), a being who can see all timelines, they track Boris down. J also learns a secret, something old Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) had never told him.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nWhen Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), an alien who is the last of his race, is confined to LunarMax, a penal colony on the moon, he escapes and goes to Earth to get the man who placed him there, M.I.B. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). He confronts K, K and J (Will Smith) corner him, but he disappears. J asks K who he is, but K doesn\'t want to say anything. J goes to M.I.B. Headquarters and learns who Boris is, but before he could learn more, the Agent in charge, O (Dame Emma Thompson), stops him. The next day, J goes to pick up K, but finds someone else living at his apartment. When he goes to M.I.B., he looks for K, but everyone there tells him, K died in 1969 after tackling with Boris. But J says K captured him. That\'s when alien vessels which are from Boris\' planet show up, and they\'re about to devour the Earth. But J says that K placed a barrier that keeps them from entering Earth in 1969, which would lead to their extinction. It\'s obvious that Boris went back in time and killed K before he could deploy the barrier. So J goes to see an alien on Earth whose father was also at the penal colony, who J assumes told Boris that he worked on time travel and his son has the device. J goes to see him and tells him about the invasion. So he sends J back just before K\'s death. J arrives in 1969 and fails to stop Boris and is captured by the younger K (Josh Brolin) who asks him who he is, and what is he doing here. J was told not to tell him anything. But with time running out J tells him, but K doesn\'t believe him at first, so they go out to stop Boris. Only problem, J doesn\'t exactly know what happened, so he\'s not sure where they should go.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nCriminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from LunarMax, a moon-based maximum security prison. He comes to Earth seeking revenge on Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), who shot off his arm and arrested him forty years ago, and protected Earth from a Boglodyte invasion. Boris is defeated again, and he travels back in time to 1969 to kill Agent K (Josh Brolin). When Agent J notes that the timeline has changed in the present day and Agent O (Dame Emma Thompson) tells him that K died in 1969, he decides to travel to July 15, 1969 to save K the following day. Agent J has difficulties to convince the Young Agent K with lies, but when he decides to tell the truth, K believes in his words and they seek out Boris together. They are helped by the amicable alien Griiffin (Jemaine Clement), who has precognitive powers and gives the ArcNet to K to protect Earth from the Boglodyte invasion. Furthermore, J learns a secret about K and himself.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nAgents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) have seen some inexplicable things in Agent J\'s fourteen years with the Men In Black intelligence agency. When an alien assassin by the name of Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from the LunarMax prison, all bets are off. Time travel has been discovered and Boris tracks down the people who are responsible for creating it. Boris travels back in time to 1969 - the year that Agent K had shot off his arm and deployed a shield that led to Boris\' race\'s extinction. As Agent J delves deep into the case, he soon finds himself travelling back to 1969. There, he meets the young Agent K (Josh Brolin) - who is every bit as awkward and demeaning as the elder Agent K is. J and K have their differences, but soon discovers that Boris has a much more sinister motive than originally thought. With the help of an alien super being named Griffin who can see into alternate realities, J and K begin a pursuit of Boris The Animal that takes them to Cape Canaveral, Florida just in time for the Apollo 11 launch. There, secrets that could change time and space forever are revealed.\r\n-\r\nhalo1k\r\n\r\nAfter nearly four decades of imprisonment, the hideous extraterrestrial and Agent K\'s arch-nemesis, Boris the Animal, manages to escape the lunar maximum-security prison, Lunar Max, bent on revenge. With this in mind, the powerful alien travels back in time to 1969, where a fresh and inexperienced version of a young Agent K exists; however, Agent J, too, takes a step back in history, teaming up with his old/new taciturn companion, to thwart the interplanetary visitor\'s evil schemes. Nevertheless, can this brand-new team of reluctant partners re-establish order and peace in the universe?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-26 14:32:44','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::10\r\nCanada::PG\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nMongolia::PG\r\nNetherlands::9\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::G\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::12+\r\nSaudi Arabia::G\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::7\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-13\r\nVietnam::P',12),(419,'0391198','The Grudge','Grudge','The Grudge\r\nEl grito\r\nO Grito\r\nГняв\r\nRage meurtrière\r\nKletva\r\nNenávist\r\nForbandelsen\r\nVimm\r\nKauna\r\nDer Fluch\r\nDer Fluch - The Grudge\r\nI katara\r\nΗ κατάρα\r\nÁtok\r\nHa-Tina\r\nThe Juon\r\nTHE JUON 呪怨\r\nNiknuma varā\r\nPagieza\r\nLa maldición\r\nForbannelsen\r\nThe Grudge: Klątwa\r\nThe Grudge - A Maldição\r\nBlestemul\r\nПроклятие\r\nКлетва\r\n不死咒怨\r\nGarez\r\nПрокляття\r\nUntitled \'Ju-on: The Grudge\' Remake',2004,91,5.9,142989,'English\r\nJapanese','United States\r\nJapan','Horror\r\nMystery\r\nThriller','Takashi Shimizu','Stephen Susco\r\nTakashi Shimizu','Doug Davison\r\nJoseph Drake\r\nSatoshi Fukushima\r\nAubrey Henderson\r\nTakashige Ichise\r\nNathan Kahane\r\nMichael Kirk\r\nRoy Lee\r\nCarsten H.W.

Karen must now find a way to break this spell, before she becomes its next victim.\r\n-\r\nsimon\r\n\r\nCaretaker Yoko doesn\'t show up for work so exchange student nurse Karen is sent to take care of an American family living in a house in Tokyo. She discovers the haunting spirits of the Grudge and investigates the ghosts and they\'re reason for haunting.\r\n-\r\nahmetkozan\r\n\r\nThe normal façade of a modest house in Tokyo belies the hidden terror within. It is possessed by a violent plague that destroys the lives of everyone who enters. Known as The Grudge, this curse causes its victims to die in the grip of a powerful rage. Those who are fatally afflicted by the curse die and a new curse is born--passed like a virus to all those who enter the house in an endless, growing chain of horror. Karen is an exchange student studying social work in Japan who innocently agrees to cover for a nurse who didn\'t show up for work. When she enters the assigned home, she discovers an elderly American woman, Emma, who is lost in a catatonic state while the rest of the house appears deserted and disheveled. As she is tending to the stricken old woman, Karen hears scratching sounds from upstairs. When she investigates, she is faced with a supernatural horror more frightening than she could ever imagine. Within this house, a chain of terror has been set in motion resulting from a terrifying evil that was born years before. As more people die, Karen is pulled into the cycle of horror and learns the secret of the vengeful curse that has taken root in this house. Now she must stop it before it\'s too late.\r\n-\r\nSujit R. Varma\r\n\r\nAfter Yoko fails to show up for work, Karen Davis, an exchange Nurse-student from the states living in Tokyo, is asked to check on Emma an American lady, who recently moved to Japan with her son, daughter and daughter in-law Jennifer. Whilst inside the house, Karen is alarmed by Emma\'s unusual behavior: She is mute and sleeps through the day. Karen then soon discovers that the house is haunted by a curse, a curse that will consume anyone who enters the house. Now after several horrific deaths, she finds herself locked in a race against time for she too is consumed by The Grudge...\r\n-\r\nBHamazonking\r\n\r\nKaren Davis is a woman residing in Japan with her boyfriend, who is studying there. Temporarily assigned to be caretaker for a woman with severe sleeping disorder, Karen goes to the patient\'s house. What she finds is something she would never expect. The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse. The curse is born from someone dying in a powerful rage. Now, Karen finds herself being tormented by that curse, as it eventually starts claiming it\'s victims.\r\n-\r\nmystic80','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-26 14:33:39','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::18\r\nCzechia::15\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::15\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18SG\r\nMexico::18+\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::PG-13',12),(420,'1815862','After Earth','After Earth','After Earth\r\nDespués de la Tierra\r\nDepois da Terra\r\nЗемята: Ново начало\r\nAprès la Terre\r\nZemlja: Novi početak\r\nPo zániku Země\r\nPärast maailmalõppu\r\nA Föld után\r\nAbaya Graham\r\nHa\'olam aharey\r\nAfter Earth - Dopo la fine del mondo\r\nAfutâ Âsu\r\nアフター・アース\r\nAtgriešanās uz Zemes\r\nŽeme - nauja pradžia\r\nDespués de la tierra\r\n1000 lat po Ziemi\r\n1000 post Terra\r\nПосле нашей эры\r\nNakon Zemlje\r\nPo zániku Zeme\r\n地球過後\r\nDünya - Yeni Bir Başlangıç\r\nЗемля після нашої ери\r\n1000 A.E.\r\nTrở Về Trái Đất',2013,100,4.8,198312,'English','United States','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nSci-Fi','M.

With Cypher injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help.\r\n\r\nOne thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity\'s escape from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind\'s new home. Legendary General Cypher Raige returns from an extended tour of duty to his estranged family, ready to be a father to his 13-year-old son, Kitai. When an asteroid storm damages Cypher and Kitai\'s craft, they crash-land on a now unfamiliar and dangerous Earth. As his father lies dying in the cockpit, Kitai must trek across the hostile terrain to recover their rescue beacon. His whole life, Kitai has wanted nothing more than to be a soldier like his father. Today, he gets his chance.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nIn the future, Earth becomes inhabitable and mankind moves to Nova Prime. However, aliens try to conquer Nova Prime but are defeated by the Rangers under the command of General Cypher Raige. The aliens bring the predator Ursas to hunt down the humans attracted by their fear and Raige develops the fearless ghosting technique to defeat them. On the same day that Raige returns home, his estranged son Kitai Raige is not advanced to the Ranger position in the academy. Raige promises his wife that he will travel in his last assignment before retirement and she convinces him to bring Kitai with him. When their spacecraft is damaged by an asteroid storm, she crashes on Earth and only Raige and Kitai survive. Raige breaks both legs and Kitai needs to cross the hostile and dangerous planet to retrieve the beacon and save their lives.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIt\'s been nearly a millennium since mankind was forced to flee their home planet for the safety of Nova Prime, and in that time Earth has grown increasingly hostile to human life. Gen. Cypher Raige (Will Smith) has just finished an extended tour of duty when he reunites with his 13-year-old son Kitai (Jaden Smith), and begins making the transition from military leader to father. When an asteroid storm damages their ship, however, a badly injured Cypher and his son are forced to crash-land on Earth. Now, the only way for young Kitai to save his father\'s life is to find the rescue beacon that was lost when their ship came plummeting through the atmosphere. In order to survive and succeed, Kitai will have to become the type of soldier who would make his father proud..\r\n\r\nEager to follow in his father\'s footsteps--the battle-hardened General Cypher Raige--his teenage son and hopeful ranger, Kitai, will find himself fighting for his life when an unforeseen catastrophe during a routine space voyage maroons both on a quarantined and perilous Earth. With Cypher incapacitated and in the middle of a hostile alien environment, Kitai must put his rigorous training in the academy to good use to have a fighting chance of saving their lives. Nearly one hundred kilometres of arduous trek brimming with formidable adversaries and ferocious apex predators separate the ill-fated survivors from a faint hope of success. Can Kitai live up to his father\'s expectations?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-08-27 13:48:51','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNigeria::PG\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::Apt\r\nPhilippines::G\r\nPoland::16\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSaudi Arabia::PG\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::7-9\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::13A\r\nUnited Kingdom::12A\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::PG-15',12),(421,'2936390','Battle Drone','Battle Drone','Battle Drone\r\nA harci drón\r\nバトル・ドローン\r\nBitwa dronów\r\nЗагнанный\r\nHunted: Battle of the Drones\r\nHunted\r\nBattle of the Drones',2018,93,5.1,4889,'English','United States','Action\r\nSci-Fi','Mitch Gould','Jo Marr\r\nMichael Philip\r\nMitch Gould','Robert Benvie\r\nJames T.

Due to the intense enemy fire, the planes are shot down and most soldiers die in the landing or are killed by the Nazis\' night patrols after they land. However, a private named Ed Boyce survives to find Corporal Ford, a last-minute incorporation from Italy and a veteran expert in bombs and explosives, rogue sniper Tibbet, war photographer Chase, and finally private Dawson. After they watch the killing of their superior Sergeant Eldson by a Nazi night patrol, Ford becomes leader of the group and they try to get the town with the tower in order to complete the mission. In the forest close to the town they meet Chloe, a villager who assists the soldiers in her home with her elderly aunt and little brother Paul. But the mission gets complicated when, by accident, Boyce ends up inside the Nazi radio tower, only to find horrible secret experiments with human beings that could empower a victory for Hitler and would change the fate of the world forever. With D-Day approaching, Boyce and the others begin to realize there is more going on in this Nazi-occupied village than a simple military operation. They not only have to fight against soldiers to destroy the radio tower, but also against the results of the experiments to turn the entire place to ruins. All this before dawn and Hitler gets his Third Reich of a thousand years that he promised.\r\n-\r\nChockys\r\n\r\nOn the eve of D-Day, a paratrooper squad is sent to destroy a German radio tower in an old church; however, their plane is shot down before they can reach their target, leaving only five apparent survivors, Corporal Ford and soldiers Boyce, Tibbet, Chase, and Dawson. Dawson is killed by a landmine but the team continues onward, running into a French woman named Chloe who agrees to take them into the village where the radio tower is located. The soldiers learn that Chloe lives with her 8-year-old brother Paul and her aunt, who has been disfigured by Nazi experiments taking place in the church. After Tibbet and Chase depart to check the scheduled rendezvous site, the remaining soldiers are forced to hide in the attic when a Nazi patrol performs a routine inspection. But when SS Hauptsturmführer Wafner attempts to rape Chloe, Boyce attacks him, forcing the soldiers to take him prisoner..\r\n\r\nD-Day, 6 June 1944. A platoon of US paratroopers enters a village to discover that there is a German laboratory nearby. The Germans are developing a serum that turns their troops into indestructible super-soldiers.

Jun Seok proposes one last heist to his best friends Jang Ho and Ki Hoon, in order for the trio to escape from their miserable situations. Their target is an illegal gambling house, which stores hefty stacks of US dollars. The trio recruits Sang Soo, who currently works in the gambling house. After getting firearms from Bong Shik, a friend Jun Seok knew in prison, the quartet proceeds with the heist, which finishes messy but successful.

To conceal their crime, the sisters must go deep into the criminal underbelly of their hometown, uncovering the town\'s darkest secrets.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Easter Cove, a remote and insular fishing village on Maine\'s rocky coast. In this small town, bonds run as deep as the ocean and secrets are as thick as the morning fog. Each day, droves of men take to sea for the daily catch while a handful of women serve as the community\'s powerful, albeit discrete, operators. Though the self-interested code of the town\'s old guard has governed for years, our tale takes place as the tides are turning in Easter Cove. Mary Margaret Connolly, a beloved and integral town matriarch, has just passed away. In the wake of her death, her daughters, Mary Beth and Priscilla, face an uncertain future, haunted by bills and unpaid loans left behind. Priscilla tries to fill her mother\'s shoes by taking over the family fish shop while her younger sister Mary Beth refuses to accept the new responsibilities. The sisters find themselves at odds and Mary Beth stubbornly defends her dream of leaving town - even if it means abandoning Priscilla altogether. Meanwhile, across town, at a bed and breakfast-turned-brothel, established town elder and madame Enid Nora Devlin is up to business as usual, except for two huge problems: someone stole $50K in cash and one of her girls, Dee, has gone missing. With little else to do, she sends her muscle, an outsider named Gorski, in pursuit of the cash and Dee. After a series of chance wrong turns sets Gorski on a collision course with Mary Beth, she accidentally kills him and must turn to the only person she has left: her sister. Together, the Connolly sisters must cover up Mary Beth\'s mistake and figure out what to do with the mysterious bag of cash they found in his shack. When Dee\'s body washes up on shore, the town\'s remaining matriarchs - Doreen, Gail and Susie - snap into action. These three, along with Enid and Mary Margaret, have quietly maintained the code of conduct for decades, navigating the murky water of the town\'s dubious past. The matriarchs intervene and make it their business to decide Enid\'s fate - as well as the fate of the Connolly sisters.','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-09-17 07:43:43','','','','','',0,0,0,'Brazil::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nItaly::VM16\r\nMexico::16\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSpain::16\r\nUnited Kingdom::N/C 15+\r\nUnited States::R',16),(438,'7939766','I\'m Thinking of Ending Things','I\'m Thinking of Ending Things','I\'m Thinking of Ending Things\r\nPienso en el final\r\nEstou Pensando em Acabar com Tudo\r\nJe veux juste en finir\r\nΣκέφτομαι να Βάλω Τέλος\r\nA befejezésen gondolkozom\r\nSto pensando di finirla qui\r\nもう終わりにしよう。\r\nMoże pora z tym skończyć\r\nTudo Acaba Agora\r\nMă gândesc să-i pun capăt\r\nДумаю, как всё закончить\r\nРазмишљам о окончању\r\nAsi to ukončím\r\nEstoy pensando en dejarlo\r\n我想結束這一切\r\nHer Şeyi Bitirmeyi Düşünüyorum\r\nЯ думаю з усім цим покінчити\r\nЯ думаю закінчити це все\r\nأفكّر في إنهاء الأمور\r\nCó Chăng Nên Chấm Dứt',2020,134,6.6,78556,'English\r\nSpanish','United States','Drama\r\nThriller','Charlie Kaufman','Charlie Kaufman\r\nIain Reid','Stefanie Azpiazu\r\nAnthony Bregman\r\nPeter Cron\r\nCharlie Kaufman\r\nMatt Levin\r\nIain Reid\r\nRobert Salerno\r\nGregory Zuk','Jay Wadley','Jesse Plemons\r\nJessie Buckley\r\nToni Collette\r\nDavid Thewlis\r\nGuy Boyd\r\nHadley Robinson\r\nGus Birney\r\nAbby Quinn\r\nColby Minifie\r\nAnthony Robert Grasso\r\nTeddy Coluca\r\nJason Ralph\r\nOliver Platt\r\nFrederick Wodin\r\nRyan Steele\r\nUnity Phelan\r\nNorman Aaronson\r\nAshlyn Alessi\r\nMonica Ayres\r\nVarvara Cardenas\r\nDj Nino Carta\r\nJulie Chateauvert\r\nLiggera Edmonds-Allen\r\nBrooke Elardo\r\nAustin Ferris\r\nJames Glorioso Jr.\r\nThomas Hatz\r\nDannielle Rose\r\nKamran Saliani\r\nAlbert Skowronski\r\nIra Temchin','','Full of misgivings, a young woman travels with her new boyfriend to his parents\' secluded farm.

On a trip with his brother, Saroo soon finds himself alone and trapped in a moving decommissioned passenger train that takes him to Calcutta, 1000 miles away from home. Now totally lost in an alien urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. However, for all his material good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend. Only when he has an epiphany does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\r\n\r\nIn 1986, in Khandwa, India, the 5 year-old boy Saroo lives a very poor but happy life with his mother Kamla, his older brother Guddu and his younger sister Shekila. Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank in the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy. He tells the story of his childhood and triggers the feeling of missing his family. Now Saroo becomes obsessed to find his mother Kamla and his siblings. Will he succeed in his search?\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nNorthern India, 1986. Guddu and his younger brother Saroo help out their impoverished family by scavenging anything they can. One night Guddu and Saroo are separated at a train station. Saroo tries to find Guddu but ends up on a train that takes him to Calcutta, 1,600 kms away. In Calcutta he is taken in by a organisation that finds adoptive parents for orphans and lost kids. Saroo is adopted by an Australian couple, the Brierleys, and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. 20 years later he decides to find his mother and brother.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nBased on the true story of Saroo Brierley who, at the age of 5, was separated from his family in India as he fell asleep on a train and woke up 1600 kilometers away from home. Saroo was later adopted by an Australian couple and after 25 years, he began searching for his Indian family.\r\n-\r\nNoura\r\n\r\nIn 1986, Saroo, a five-year-old boy, lives with his elder brother Guddu, his mother and his younger sister in Khandwa, India. Guddu and Saroo steal coal from freight trains to trade for milk and food. One day, Saroo follows his brother to a job and they arrive at a nearby train station, where Saroo decides to stay back and take a nap. Guddu tries to wake him up, but Saroo is too tired. When Guddu does not return, Saroo searches for him and boards a train presuming Guddu is aboard. He falls asleep again in one of the compartments, and wakes up to find the train in motion. After several days, it arrives in faraway Calcutta, where he does not understand the local Bengali language. He stands at a ticket counter and tries to obtain a ticket home, but the attendant does not recognize the name of his village, which Saroo says is \"Genestalay\".[4] He spends the night in the station with some street-children, but is then woken up and forced to run when a group of men try to kidnap them.\r\n\r\nSaroo Brierley grew up one of two adopted sons of South Asian descent of Caucasian couple Sue and John Brierley in Hobart, Tasmania, Saroo, approaching age six, joining the family in 1987, his brother, Mantosh Brierley, joining the family one year later. At the time, Saroo, solely speaking Hindi and not Bengali as would be expected from the location, was discovered alone on the streets of Calcutta, a search for his biological family which yielded nothing. While Saroo eventually adjusted well to the situation of life within a white family in Australia, Mantosh, suffering from ADHD, never did despite the support of the family, especially Sue. While away at school in Melbourne in a hotel management program in 2008, Saroo, triggered by a sensory touchstone, begins to remember that he didn\'t actually grow up in Calcutta, but somewhere else in India - he remembering the name \"Ganestalay\", probably a mispronunciation of an actual geographic place or an unofficial name of a neighborhood - one of three offspring of a single, illiterate mother, he, having been separated from his older brother Guddu one night at the local train station, stumbling onto an empty train in searching for a comfortable place to sleep which led to his unexpected two day journey to Calcutta. Spurred by his friends to use the technology of the day, most specifically Google Earth in remembering a local landmark at that train station, Saroo goes on a technological search for his pre-Calcutta life, most specifically his biological family. This process begins to alienate himself from Sue and John, who he doesn\'t tell in not wanting to appear ungrateful to them, and his Caucasian girlfriend Lucy in the guilt of what ended up being his privileged life while his biological family had nothing.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',0,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-09-20 07:25:38','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nAustria::10\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nColombia::T\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-12\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::U\r\nIreland::PG\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nLithuania::N-13\r\nLuxembourg::12\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::PG\r\nNorway::9\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Africa::7-9\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nThailand::G\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::PG\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::16+',0),(442,'5797184','Escape from Pretoria','Escape from Pretoria','Escape from Pretoria\r\nFuga de Pretoria\r\nFuga de Pretória\r\nБягство от Претория\r\n逃离比勒陀利亚\r\nÚtěk z Pretorie\r\nPõgenemine Pretoriast\r\nFlucht aus Pretoria\r\nSzökés Pretoriából\r\nプリズン・エスケープ 脱出への10の鍵\r\nUcieczka z Pretorii\r\nПобег из Претории\r\n鑰命監獄\r\nPretoria\'dan Kaçış\r\nВтеча з Преторії\r\nPretoriyadan qochish\r\nPhi Vụ Đào Tẩu',2020,106,6.8,33221,'English\r\nFrench','United Kingdom\r\nAustralia\r\nUnited States\r\nSouth Africa\r\nGermany','Thriller','Francis Annan','Francis Annan\r\nL.H.

Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.\r\n\r\nWelcome to a world where time has become the ultimate currency. You stop aging at 25, but there\'s a catch: you\'re genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich \"earn\" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo\'s love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system.\r\n-\r\nTwentieth Century Fox\r\n\r\nIn a future society, people are genetically modified to stop aging at twenty five and after that a clock is activated with one more year for each citizen. Time is a currency and the wealthy that live in the New Greenwich are immortals while the poor live in ghettos in time zones are exploited and forced to live with a few hours or days, and need to work, borrow, beg or steal to stay alive. Thieves steal time and the timekeepers control the society. When the worker Will Salas saves the rich Henry Hamilton from a dangerous gang of thieves, Henry tells that he is 105 years old and is tired of living, since there is no need for the deaths in the unfair society. When Will sleeps, Henry gives more than one hundred years to him and commits suicide. Will runs to meet his mother Rachel Salas to credit time to her but she dies before the transference. Will heads to New Greenwich but the timekeeper Raymond Leon believes that he killed Henry to steal his time. Will flirts with Sylvia Weis, who is the spoiled daughter of the millionaire Philippe Weis, in a party and when Raymond arrests him, Will Salas kidnaps Sylvia and brings her to the ghetto where he lives. Sylvia feels how despicable her father is and together with Will, they steal a large quantity of time to fight against the system.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn a future society people have been engineered not to age once reaching 25 but can only live for one more year as time is now the currency. Those who trade it can live for more than a 100 years. Society\'s classes are divided into what they call time zones. The richest live in the Greenwich section. One of the residents of Greenwich wanders into the poor section where someone sees how much time he has which is 100 years and wants to steal it. Will Salas, a decent guy saves him but he tells Will that he wanted to die because he\'s tired of a system wherein someone has to die for others to live. While Will is sleeping he gives Will his time and walks off to die. Will goes off to share it with his mother but she dies because of inflation. Will heads off to Greenwich. He then meets a girl named Sylvia whose father is the one behind the system. A law enforcement office known as a Timekeeper who\'s investigating the death of the man who gave Will his time, assumes that Will stole it. So he confiscates it and arrests Will. Will then takes Sylvia hostage and runs off with her. He goes back to his time zone and asks for a ransom but when her father doesn\'t give it. He lets her go but when she\'s in danger Will saves her and they decide to work together to take down the system.\r\n-\r\nrcs0411@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nIn the future when the aging gene has been switched off, people must pay to stay alive. To avoid overpopulation, time has become the currency that people use to pay for luxuries and necessities from a clock implanted in their forearm. This can easily be transferred among individuals on body contact. The rich can live forever, while the rest try to negotiate for their immortality. A poor young man is accused of murder when he inherits a fortune of time from a dead upper class man, though too late to help his mother from dying. He is forced to go on the run from a corrupt police force known as \'time keepers\'.\r\n-\r\nNicky Mitchell\r\n\r\nWhen scientists unlock the secret to immortality, time becomes the new currency and one desperate man comes under attack from a mysterious group known only as the \"Time Keepers.\" In the not-too-distant future, scientists have discovered a way to turn off the aging gene. As the threat of overpopulation looms over society, money becomes a thing of the past. Now, assets are measured in time; those with the most time also possess the most power. Meanwhile, the lower classes are forced to barter with the new elite if they want to live forever. Suddenly a young commoner stumbles across a treasure chest of time. With the \"Time Keepers\" in hot pursuit, however, he may never get a chance to use it.','Blu-ray',1,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-09-21 09:41:20','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::M\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nChile::TE+7\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-13\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nHungary::12\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::B\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG13\r\nSouth Africa::13\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::12\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTurkey::G\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::13+',12),(444,'0082971','Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark','Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark','Raiders of the Lost Ark\r\nIndiana Jones y los cazadores del arca perdida\r\nLos cazadores del arca perdida\r\nOs Caçadores da Arca Perdida\r\nIndiana Jones e os Caçadores da Arca Perdida\r\nПохитители на изчезналия кивот\r\nLes aventuriers de l\'arche perdue\r\n夺宝奇兵\r\nIndiana Jones i otimači izgubljenog kovčega\r\nDobyvatelé ztracené archy\r\nJagten på den forsvundne skat\r\nIndiana Jones kadunud laeka jälil\r\nJakten på den försvunna skatten\r\nKadonneen aarteen metsästäjät\r\nLes Aventuriers de l\'arche perdue\r\nIndiana Jones et les Aventuriers de l\'arche perdue\r\nJäger des verlorenen Schatzes\r\nOi kynigoi tis hamenis kivotou\r\nΟι Κυνηγοί της Χαμένης Κιβωτού\r\nΟ Ιντιάνα Τζόουνς και οι Κυνηγοί της Χαμένης Κιβωτού\r\nAz elveszett frigyláda fosztogatói\r\nInnrás týndu arkarinnar\r\nLast Pelaiyin Reytars\r\nLosta Arkace Rayadarsa\r\nIndiana Jones Ve\'Shodeday Ha\'Teiva Ha\'Avouda\r\nIndiana Jones e i predatori dell\'arca perduta\r\nI predatori dell\'arca perduta\r\nReidâsu/Ushinawareta âku\r\nレイダース　失われたアーク《聖櫃》\r\nIndiana Džounsas ir dingusios Sandoros skrynios ieškotojai\r\nIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\r\nJakten på den forsvunne skatten\r\nIndiana Jones i poszukiwacze zaginionej Arki\r\nPoszukiwacze zaginionej Arki\r\nOs Salteadores da Arca Perdida\r\nIndiana Jones în cautarea arcei pierdute\r\nIndiana Jones și căutătorii arcei pierdute\r\nИндиана Джонс: В поисках утраченного ковчега\r\nИндијана Џоунс и отимачи изгубљеног ковчега\r\nDobyvatelia stratenej archy\r\nLov za izgubljenim zakladom\r\nA la recerca de l\'arca perduda\r\nIndiana Jones en busca del arca perdida\r\nEn busca del arca perdida\r\nArka galduaren bila\r\n法櫃奇兵\r\nKhum Sap Sut Khop Fa\r\nKutsal Hazine Avcıları\r\nІндіана Джонс: У пошуках втраченого ковчега\r\nIndiana Jones\r\nThe Adventures of Indiana Smith\r\nCazadores del arca perdida\r\nIndiana Jones Và Chiếc Rương Thánh Tích\r\nIndijana dzouns - Otimaci izgubljenog kovcega',1981,115,8.4,933266,'English\r\nGerman\r\nHebrew\r\nSpanish\r\nArabic\r\nNepali','United States','Action\r\nAdventure','Steven Spielberg','Lawrence Kasdan\r\nGeorge Lucas\r\nPhilip Kaufman','Howard G.

An archeology professor named Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles of South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap but miraculously escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to human existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Rene Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it.\r\n-\r\nJohn Wiggins\r\n\r\nAs the Third Reich continues its reign of terror, Adolf Hitler is on a quest for the legendary Ark of the Covenant- resting place of the Ten Commandments- whose supernatural powers, legend says, can wipe out entire armies.

But, this is a frenzied race against time, and the road to the coveted relic passes through Indy\'s scheming arch-rival, Dr René Belloq, and the sadistic Gestapo commander Major Toht\'s armed-to-the-teeth army.

Eddie is young, good looking and plenty of libido to spare. Using the screen name Dirk Diggler, he quickly rises to the top of his industry winning awards year after year. Drugs and ego however come between Dirk and those around him and he soon finds that fame is fleeting.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nSan Fernando Valley, 1977. Jack Horner is a renowned director of porn, all his movies financed by \"Colonel\" James. He has his regular stable of cast and crew, most who have issues in their lives. They include: actress Amber Waves, who acts as the mother figure to the group in the absence of being a real mother to her biological son, about who she has told no one in her porn circle; actor Reed Rothchild, who wants to live up to his on-screen alpha male status; actor Buck Swope, who works as a stereo salesman on the side and whose country & western style seems to be problematic in getting ahead; actress Rollergirl, a high school drop-out who never takes off her skates; and assistant director \"Little\" Bill, whose marriage is threatened by his wife being both a nymphomaniac and an exhibitionist. Their collective lives are punctuated by excess in everything, whether it be sex, cocaine use, or the need to amass flashy material possessions. Into their lives comes Eddie Adams, a seventeen year old high school dropout from a dysfunctional family in Torrance. Eddie, who renames himself Dirk Diggler, is Jack\'s latest discovery, and whose success in the industry is largely predicated on being well-endowed. Because of the validation he receives for the first time in his life, Dirk is easy prey to be sucked into the excesses of the group. Although largely an innocent beyond the few dollars previously earned here and there by showing his penis to anyone who would pay, Dirk also changes as a person as he displays more and more bravado in relation to the amount of validation he receives. The next few years lead to changes in the group, not only because of changes in technology, namely the advent of video, but as the excesses in their lives start to take their toll, and as their association with the business may affect what their post-porn life will look like.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nFrom writer/director P.T. Anderson comes the turbulent behind-the-scenes story of an extended family of filmmakers who set out to revolutionize the adult entertainment industry in the seventies. Idealistic producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) has always dreamed of elevating his films into an art form. When he discovers young actor Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), Jack begins to turn his dreams into reality. Under the stage name of Dirk Diggler, Eddie soon gives the adult entertainment world a star the likes of which it has never seen. But the rise to fame has its costs, and soon Dirk finds himself sliding down the slippery slope of sex, drugs and violence. The only question: can he get himself back together before it\'s too late?\r\n\r\nEddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era.\r\n-\r\nJohn Selbie\r\n\r\nEddie Adams, a young man working in a nightclub, is discovered by porn director Jack Horner, who soon puts Eddie, renamed Dirk Diggler, and his \"talent\" on the top of the pornography industry. But when the 1980s arrive, Dirk and his colleagues in the porn industry have to cope with a new era as well as the baggage they bring with them from the 1970s.\r\n-\r\nMike Myers\r\n\r\nEddie is an aspiring actor who gets discovered by Jack Horner, a porn director who considers his job an art form. Eddie then changes his name to Dirk Diggler and gets sucked in the lifestyle and relationships of the pornography industry of the late-1970s.\r\n-\r\nSteve Richer','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-10-13 10:31:46','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::18\r\nAustralia::R\r\nBrazil::18\r\nCanada::16+\r\nColombia::18\r\nCzechia::15\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-16\r\nFrance::16\r\nGermany::16\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::18\r\nIreland::18\r\nItaly::VM14\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nMalaysia::(Banned)\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPeru::18\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::18+\r\nSingapore::R21\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(447,'0783233','Atonement','Atonement','Atonement\r\nExpiación, deseo y pecado\r\nReviens-moi\r\nDesejo e Reparação\r\nИзкупление\r\nExpiation\r\nOkajanje\r\nPokání\r\nSoning\r\nLepitus\r\nSovitus\r\nMonanieba\r\nAbbitte\r\nExileosi\r\nΕξιλέωση\r\nVágy és vezeklés\r\nMokafat\r\nKapara\r\nEspiazione\r\nTsugunai\r\nつぐない\r\nPiedošana\r\nAtpirkimas\r\nOm forlatelse\r\nPokuta\r\nExpiação\r\nRemuscare\r\nИскупление\r\nПокајање\r\nPokánie\r\nPokora\r\nExpiación.

Robbie is the son of a family servant toward whom the family has always been kind. They paid for his time at Cambridge and now he plans on going to medical school. After the fountain incident, Briony reads a letter intended for Cecilia and concludes that Robbie is a deviant. When her cousin Lola (Juno Temple) is raped, she tells the Police that it was Robbie she saw committing the deed.\r\n-\r\ngarykmcd\r\n\r\nIn 1939, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) is a Private in the British Army, he and his battalion who are heading to France to fight in the war. A stint in the army is not where his life was headed, which took a radical turn four years earlier at the Tallis estate where he grew up as his mother worked as the Tallis\' live-in housekeeper. As such, he grew up with the three Tallis children: son Leon (Patrick Kennedy), and daughters Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Briony (Saoirse Ronan). Robbie and Cecilia were just getting to the stage of their lives of being able to confess their true love for each other. But then thirteen-year-old aspiring writer Briony also had a crush on the older Robbie. Based on two incidents she saw between Cecilia and Robbie (one only from afar), on reading a private letter Robbie wrote to Cecilia, and on her own feelings for Robbie, Briony told some truths and half-truths about Robbie which resulted in this turn in his life. Robbie is able to reconnect with Cecilia before he is shipped off to France, and lives only to be able to head back to London to be with Cecilia and make up for the missing four years they could not spend together due to Briony\'s actions. A year later, Briony (Romola Garai), now eighteen, also arrives in London to start working as a nurse to support the war effort. By this time, she is aware of the damage her thirteen-year-old self caused, and wants to atone for that error to Cecilia, from whom she has been estranged, and Robbie, who she has not seen since. She will make this atonement even if neither Robbie or Cecilia will ever speak to her, or if it takes the rest of her life.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nThe day that thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) came across her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and her lover Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) making love in the library was a day that would have repercussions for all three of them. Briony misunderstands what has taken place between them and her reaction later tears the two lovers apart perhaps forever as war breaks out in Britain.\r\n-\r\nmel47','Blu-ray',0,1,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-10-13 10:33:03','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::K-12/9\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nHong Kong::IIB\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::18\r\nIndonesia::D\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::PG-12\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNorway::11\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::12\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::11\r\nSwitzerland::12\r\nTaiwan::PG-12\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',16),(448,'8526872','Dolemite Is My Name','Dolemite Is My Name','Dolemite Is My Name\r\nMeu Nome é Dolemite\r\nMi Nombre es Dolemite\r\nΜε Λένε Dolemite\r\nA nevem Dolemite\r\nルディ・レイ・ムーア\r\nDolemite\r\nNazywam się Dolemite\r\nChamem-me Dolemite\r\nМеня зовут Долемайт\r\nYo soy Dolemite\r\n我叫多麥特\r\nBana Dolemite Derler\r\nМоє ім\'я - Долмайт\r\nTên Tôi Là Dolemite',2019,118,7.3,59049,'English','United States','Biography\r\nComedy\r\nDrama','Craig Brewer','Scott Alexander\r\nLarry Karaszewski','Michael Beugg\r\nJohn Davis\r\nJohn Fox\r\nCharisse M.

Shannon convinces a mob acquaintance, Bernie Rose, and Bernie\'s associate Nino to finance this venture after Bernie meets the Driver. Concurrently, the Driver starts to fall for one of his neighbors, Irene, and her young son, Benicio. Irene\'s husband, Standard Gabriel, is a petty criminal currently in prison. Solely to protect Irene and Benicio, the Driver gets involved in Standard\'s criminal life once Standard is released from prison. That criminal life takes an unexpected turn which threatens not only the Driver\'s relationship with Irene and Benicio and his possible new life as a race car driver, but his life, period, as Standard ends up unwittingly being connected back to Rose and Nino.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nDefined entirely by his profession, by day, the nameless phlegmatic driver is a mechanic and a daredevil stuntman for high-paced action movies, but by night, he\'s a masterful getaway wheelman for criminals. But when an unexpected encounter with Irene, the Driver\'s vulnerable neighbour and mother of a young son, stirs a spontaneous affection, things will soon take a turn for the worse, as a reluctant job with her ex-con husband ends up in a bloody mess. Now, on the run, blood-stained, and with a bag crammed with the Mafia\'s cash, the Driver not only has to save himself, but also to protect the defenceless Irene and her child. For years, the stoic Driver has been executing to perfection his precise escapes. Can he do it one more time?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-10-13 10:35:05','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::14\r\nChina::13\r\nColombia::15\r\nCzechia::18\r\nDenmark::15\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-17\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::17+\r\nIreland::18\r\nIsrael::16\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R15+\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::18\r\nMexico::B15\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R18\r\nNorway::15\r\nPhilippines::R-13\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRomania::I.M.-18\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::NC16\r\nSouth Africa::16\r\nSouth Korea::15\r\nSpain::18\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::16\r\nTaiwan::R-18\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::18\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',18),(450,'7846844','Enola Holmes','Enola Holmes','Enola Holmes\r\nOs Mistérios de Enola Holmes\r\nЕнола Холмс\r\n福尔摩斯小姐：失踪的侯爵\r\nEnola Holmesová\r\nΕνόλα Χολμς\r\nエノーラ・ホームズの事件簿\r\nЭнола Холмс\r\n天才少女福爾摩斯\r\nЕнола Голмс\r\nEnola Xolms',2020,123,6.6,156920,'English','United Kingdom','Action\r\nAdventure\r\nCrime\r\nDrama\r\nMystery','Harry Bradbeer','Jack Thorne\r\nNancy Springer\r\nArthur Conan Doyle','Harry Bradbeer\r\nMillie Bobby Brown\r\nPaige Brown\r\nMichael Dreyer\r\nAlex Garcia\r\nJoshua Grode\r\nJane Houston\r\nAli Mendes\r\nMary Parent','Daniel Pemberton','Millie Bobby Brown\r\nHenry Cavill\r\nSam Claflin\r\nHelena Bonham Carter\r\nLouis Partridge\r\nBurn Gorman\r\nAdeel Akhtar\r\nSusan Wokoma\r\nHattie Morahan\r\nDavid Bamber\r\nFrances de la Tour\r\nClaire Rushbrook\r\nFiona Shaw\r\nGaby French\r\nPaul Copley\r\nEllie Haddington\r\nAlex Kelly\r\nJames Duke\r\nConnor Catchpole\r\nSarah Flind\r\nDempsey Bovell\r\nNeil Bell\r\nSofia Stavrinou\r\nSophie Dixon\r\nDavid Kirkbride\r\nDelroy Atkinson\r\nMary Roscoe\r\nAnthony Aje\r\nAnthony Rickman\r\nPhilip Wallace\r\nTuyen Do\r\nEsther Coles\r\nClaire Ashton\r\nOwen Atlas\r\nJon Bentley\r\nPierre Bergman\r\nEmma Clandon\r\nSoo Cole\r\nNick Davison\r\nHayden Ellingworth\r\nAntoniya Gerimpapazi\r\nHattie Jackson\r\nMartyn Mayger\r\nAdrian Mozzi\r\nPaul Parker\r\nHeather Pearse\r\nMark Ryder\r\nSteve Saunders\r\nSonya Seva\r\nJay Simpson\r\nJoakim Skarli\r\nCharlotte Summers\r\nPeter Theobalds\r\nVanluke Watson\r\nStuart Whelan\r\nMargaret Wheldon\r\nCrystal Wingx','Mystery runs in the family\r\n\r\nYoungster.

Little does he know, Sarah\'s traveling to the same resort as her ex - and she\'s bringing along her new boyfriend.\r\n\r\nPeter is a composer and a likable sad sack who\'s devastated when his girlfriend of five years, Sarah Marshall, the star of a cheesy CSI-style crime show, dumps him. He weeps, he rails, he mopes. Finally, his step-brother Brian suggests a vacation, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu where, as he\'s checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a perverse English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by Rachel, a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. Although he constantly runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive again. Will Sarah realize what she\'s lost, and what about Rachel?\r\n-\r\n\r\nComposer and musician Peter Bretter, unmotivated in life, is unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend of five and half years, Sarah Marshall, the star of the hit television show, Crime Scene. Peter is devastated as he is in love with Sarah, who has left him for another undisclosed man. The situation is made all the more difficult for Peter as he also works on Crime Scene. Peter\'s stepbrother, Brian Bretter, trying to be his voice of reason, tells Peter among other things to go away on vacation to forget about Sarah. The place Peter chooses is the Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii, a place where Sarah had mentioned wanting to go. So it is not totally coincidental that upon Peter\'s arrival, he finds that Sarah is also there with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow, the pretentious lead singer for the band Infant Sorrow. Peter\'s plan of forgetting about Sarah is impossible, of which the staff and many of the guests at the hotel are aware, but neither Peter or Sarah refuse to let the other\'s presence at the resort make them run away. With the help of Brian, Brian\'s wife Liz and the hotel staff, Peter tries to move on with his life specifically with Rachel Jansen, one of the customer service agents at the hotel, who is carrying some emotional baggage of her own. But Peter goes into a further emotional tailspin when Sarah\'s life also takes a turn.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nWhen Sarah Marshall dumps aspiring musician Peter Bretter for rock star Aldous Snow, Peter\'s world comes crashing down. His best friend suggests that Peter should get away from everything and to fly off to Hawaii to escape all his problems. After arriving in Hawaii and meeting the beautiful Rachel Jansen, Peter is shocked to see not only Aldous Snow in Hawaii, but also Sarah Marshall.\r\n-\r\nFilmFanUk','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-10-13 10:38:16','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::16\r\nAustralia::MA15+\r\nBrazil::16\r\nCanada::18+\r\nDenmark::11\r\nFinland::K-15\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::12\r\nIceland::12\r\nIndia::18\r\nIreland::15A\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R18+\r\nMalaysia::18PL\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::12\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNorway::11\r\nPeru::14\r\nPhilippines::18+\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::13\r\nSweden::15\r\nSwitzerland::14\r\nTurkey::15+\r\nUnited Kingdom::15\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::18+',16),(452,'7395114','The Devil All the Time','Devil All the Time','The Devil All the Time\r\nEl diablo a todas horas\r\nO Diabo de Cada Dia\r\nДяволът през цялото време\r\nLe Daible, tout le temps\r\nU vječnoj borbi sa sotonom\r\nLe Diable, tout le temps\r\nDas Handwerk des Teufels\r\nΠάντα ο Διάβολος\r\nMindig az ördöggel\r\nLe strade del male\r\n悪魔はいつもそこに\r\nVelnias visada šalia\r\nDiabeł wcielony\r\nSempre o Diabo\r\nÎntotdeauna diavolul\r\nДьявол всегда здесь\r\nDiabol navždy\r\n神棄之地\r\nHer Zaman Şeytan\r\nДиявол назавжди\r\nVùng Đất Bị Ruồng Bỏ',2020,138,7.1,121317,'English','United States','Crime\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Antonio Campos','Antonio Campos\r\nPaulo Campos\r\nDonald Ray Pollock','Max Born\r\nJared Goldman\r\nJake Gyllenhaal\r\nMarc A.

Though separated by time and space, both women are at loose ends... until they discover that with the right combination of passion, fearlessness and butter, anything is possible.\r\n-\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\nIn 1949, Julia Child is in Paris, the wife of a diplomat, wondering how to spend her days. She tries hat making, bridge, and then cooking lessons at Cordon Bleu. There she discovers her passion. In 2002, Julie Powell, about to turn 30 and underemployed with an unpublished novel, decides to cook her way through \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" in a year and to blog about it. We go back and forth between these stories of two women learning to cook and finding success. Sympathetic, loving husbands support them both, and friendships, too, add zest.\r\n-\r\n\r\nIn 1949, the diplomat Paul Child and his wife Julia are expatriated to France. In Paris, the bored Julia decides to learn how to cook and later to write a book teaching American housewives how to cook French cuisine. In 2002, the frustrated secretary of a government agency Julie and her husband, the editor Eric Powell, move to an apartment in Queens over a pizzeria. Julie is an aspirant writer and loves to cook and her husband suggests her to write a blog to spend her leisure time. Julie decides to write a blog about cooking and commits herself to cook the 534 recipes written by Julia Child in her book in 365 days.\r\n-\r\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\n\r\nIn 1949, American diplomat Paul Child starts a four year posting in Paris. His wife, the physically imposing Julia Child, loves Paris life, especially the food which she finds a revelation, but has no idea what to do with her time. She decides to parlay that love of the French cuisine by taking a cooking class. Believing she is not at the beginner level, she is able to convince the snooty head of the Cordon Bleu to enroll in a class for aspiring professional chefs. Her fellow students, all young men, see her solely as a bored housewife, so she tries to prove them wrong by cooking with what she considers fearlessness. Julia eventually meets Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, who are working on among other things an English language French cookbook, which Julia would herself like as she is unable to find such. She eventually becomes a collaborator on that book, which she wants to make accessible for the average American. The book has a difficult road to publication, if it gets published at all, which is made all the more difficult with Paul\'s subsequent postings and Julia moving away from Paris. In 2002, thirty year old Julie Powell is floundering in her life. She wanted to be a writer, but works as a low level bureaucrat in a thankless job for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, dealing with the sad and/or angry calls from people affected by 9/11. Although she regularly has what she calls her \"cobb salad\" luncheons with them, she neither really likes or understands her Amherst College \"friends\", whose lives have all turned out the way they wanted. And she reluctantly moves to an apartment over a pizzeria in Queens from Brooklyn largely so that her magazine editor husband Eric Powell can be closer to his job and they can save money, of which they don\'t have much. Beyond her time with Eric, Julie\'s only sanctuary is cooking. To find some meaning in her life, Julie, on Eric\'s encouragement, decides to write a blog, the topic she chooses being her year long journey to cook the 524 recipes in Julia Child\'s \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\". Julie is determined to complete this project, project completion which has been sorely lacking in her life. It becomes the primary focus in her life, which contains its frequent meltdowns, which Eric is unsure if he can handle as part of this life. What keeps Julie largely going is the spirit of Julia, who she considers perfect, who she hopes knows about and understands her journey, and who she would someday like to meet. As Julie\'s blog becomes more well known, she also tries to keep true to the project for the sake of her readers, and also hopes it gets noticed by a publisher so that she can be a published author as was her college dream.\r\n-\r\nHuggo','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-10-13 10:42:01','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::Atp\r\nAustralia::PG\r\nBrazil::12\r\nCanada::G\r\nFinland::S\r\nFrance::Tous publics\r\nGermany::0\r\nHong Kong::IIA\r\nIndia::UA\r\nIreland::12\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::G\r\nMalaysia::P13\r\nMexico::A\r\nNetherlands::AL\r\nNew Zealand::M\r\nNorway::A\r\nPhilippines::PG-13\r\nPoland::13\r\nPortugal::M/12\r\nSingapore::PG\r\nSouth Korea::12\r\nSpain::A\r\nSweden::Btl\r\nSwitzerland::7\r\nTaiwan::GP\r\nTurkey::13+\r\nUnited Kingdom::12\r\nUnited States::PG-13',12),(454,'0079417','Kramer vs. Kramer','Kramer vs. Kramer','Kramer vs. Kramer\r\nKramer gegen Kramer\r\nKramer tegen Kramer\r\nКрамър срещу Крамър\r\nKramer contre Kramer\r\nKramer protiv Kramera\r\nKramerová verzus Kramer\r\nKramerová versus Kramer\r\nKramer mod Kramer\r\nKramer zedda Kramer\r\nKramer Krameri vastu\r\nKramer vastaan Kramer\r\nKramer mot Kramer\r\nKramer enantion Kramer\r\nΚράμερ Εναντίον Κράμερ\r\nKramer kontra Kramer\r\nKremar Banaam Kremar\r\nKramer alaihe Kramer\r\nKramer Neged Kramer\r\nKramer contro Kramer\r\nKramer, Kramer\r\nクレイマー、クレイマー\r\nKramer prieš Krameri\r\nKramer contra Kramer\r\nSprawa Kramerów\r\nKramer Contra Kramer\r\nКрамер против Крамера\r\nKramer proti Kramerju\r\n克拉瑪對克拉瑪\r\nKramer Kramer\'e karşı\r\nКрамер проти Крамера\r\nKramer Versus Kramer\r\nKramer Kramerga qarshi',1979,105,7.8,141532,'English','United States','Drama','Robert Benton','Avery Corman\r\nRobert Benton','Richard Fischoff\r\nStanley R.

His wife Joanna cannot take this anymore, so she decides to leave him. Ted is now faced with the tasks of housekeeping and taking care of himself and their young son Billy. When he has learned to adjust his life to these new responsibilities, Joanna resurfaces and wants Billy back. Ted, however, refuses to give him up, so they go to court to fight for the custody of their son.\r\n-\r\nLeon Wolters\r\n\r\nUp and coming New York advertising executive Ted Kramer believes that his role and responsibility to his family is to be the household breadwinner, which means a focus on career. Joanna Kramer, his wife of eight years, is relegated to role of housewife and mother to their five and a half year old son, Billy Kramer, as Ted doesn\'t want her to work outside the house. As such, Joanna, on the encouragement of Margaret Phelps, a recent divorcée in their apartment building and one of Joanna\'s primary confidantes, decides to abandon the marriage, and leave Billy with Ted, as she feels she can\'t properly take care of Billy in her current fragile mental state. Ted believes that Joanna is solely going through a phase, and that she will return home in a day or two, which she doesn\'t. So, Ted has to make some major adjustments in his life. Beyond the time of fitting in Joanna\'s duties into his work schedule, Ted is ill equipped to take care of the household chores and be Billy\'s sole caregiver, which is made more difficult as Billy has his own ill feelings about the entire situation. Ted and Billy go through a difficult period in learning how to deal with each other as father and son, but the relationship eventually blossoms into a truly loving one, with Margaret being one of their biggest supporters. Two issues threaten Ted and Billy\'s new-found familial happiness: the negative effect his new time priority with Billy has on maintaining a productive work life, and the arrival fifteen months later of a newly confidant Joanna, who wants custody of her son.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nOn the same day Manhattan advertising executive Ted Kramer lands the biggest account of his career, he learns that his wife, Joanna, is leaving him and their young son, Billy. Forced to raise his son alone, Ted loses his job but gains a stronger relationship with the child with the help of another single parent, Margaret. When Joanna returns to claim custody of Billy, the ensuing court battle takes a toll on everyone concerned.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nOut of the blue, after eight years, the workaholic, up-and-coming advertising executive, Ted Kramer, finds himself with his back to the wall when his emotionally fatigued wife, Joanna, announces that she wants out of the marriage. As a result, left all alone to care for their innocent six-year-old son, Billy, Ted must reinvent the father-and-son relationship, and make up for lost time. Suddenly, being a single parent becomes a daunting task, and as if that weren\'t enough, after eighteen long and challenging months, Joanna re-enters Ted\'s life, bent on claiming custody of her little boy. But, Ted will never let go of his son.

In their research, they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is.','In 2006-2007 a group of investors bet against the US mortgage market. In their research, they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is.\r\n\r\nThree separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry\'s beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry\'s information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett\'s prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don\'t know what\'s going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nBased on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar\'s Poker and Flash Boys, among others), the true story of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn\'t initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.\r\n-\r\ngrantss\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors\' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett, hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America.\r\n-\r\nJwelch5742\r\n\r\nSensing the imminent danger of a financial crisis based on inconspicuous warning signs in the mortgage-backed real estate market, back in 2008, a motley crew of bold, yet shrewd and skilful investors managed to reap immense profits just by betting against the housing market. Who could have predicted that a real-estate bubble of a such a magnitude was about to burst, and above all, what could be the devastating aftermath in a crumbling economy that left practically millions unemployed and homeless?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nChristian Bale plays Michael Burry, a former hedge-fund manager who was one of the first to forecast the collapse of the credit bubble due to excessive subprime lending.

Aspiring screenwriter Marty (Farrell) has a brilliant screenplay called Seven Psychopaths floating around in his head; unfortunately he\'s usually to hungover to make any real progress on it. Meanwhile, Marty\'s best friend Billy (Rockwell) has some great ideas for the story, but he\'s reluctant to offer input without invitation. A down-on-his-luck actor, Billy pays his rent by running a lucrative dog-napping scam with smooth-talking Hans (Walken). Just when frustrated Marty begins to fear that all of his ideas have dried up, however, Billy shows up with an adorable Shih Zhu swiped from a quick-tempered gangster (Harrelson), and a desperate trip into the desert finds the ideas flowing like drinks at an open bar.\r\n\r\nBoozy writer Marty (Farrell) is a man in search of a screenplay. He has a catchy title but no story to go along with it.

However, instead of overcoming the dismal creative rut, little by little, Jack starts losing his mind, trapped in an unforgiving environment of seemingly endless snowstorms, and a gargantuan silent prison riddled with strange occurrences and eerie visions. Now, the incessant voices inside Jack\'s head demand sacrifice. Is Jack capable of murder?\r\n-\r\nNick Riganas\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded Overlook Hotel, located in the mountains of Colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. Having recently moved from Vermont to Boulder with his wife Wendy and their adolescent son Danny, former schoolteacher Jack Torrance has just accepted the five month job as the Overlook\'s winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. In accepting the job, Jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel GM Charles Grady, acting as that season\'s winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. Beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by Danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, Wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. While Danny indirectly states he doesn\'t want to go, Wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named Tony who lives in Danny\'s mouth. When the Torrances arrive at the Overlook on October 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, Danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to Tony\'s true nature. After the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. The question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: Wendy\'s mortal fortitude, Danny\'s secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel\'s associated secrets which are slowly overtaking Jack.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nA novelist - Jack Torrance takes a job interview as winter caretaker of the isolated, old, huge and beautiful Overlook Hotel. Jack brings his wife - Wendy and his son Danny. It happens that Danny, has a mysterious power known as \"The Shining\". Danny meets Hallorann - the hotel cook in their first day arriving at the Overlook, who warns him about the hotel and the sinister Room 237. As the days go by, Danny has visions, meanwhile Jack starts driving into insanity, turning more and more aggressive, at the point that Danny and Wendy gets convinced that Jack might try to do something bad.\r\n-\r\nFilm Geek Guy','Blu-ray',1,0,'',0,'2021-12-30','','2020-10-13 10:46:21','','','','','',0,0,0,'Argentina::13\r\nAustralia::MA\r\nBrazil::14\r\nCanada::13+\r\nChile::18\r\nDenmark::16\r\nFinland::K-18\r\nFrance::12\r\nGermany::16\r\nGreece::K-17\r\nHong Kong::III\r\nHungary::18\r\nIceland::16\r\nIndia::A\r\nIndonesia::21\r\nIreland::16\r\nItaly::T\r\nJapan::R-15\r\nLithuania::N-16\r\nMalaysia::U\r\nMexico::C\r\nNetherlands::16\r\nNew Zealand::R16\r\nNigeria::15\r\nNorway::18\r\nPhilippines::R-16\r\nPoland::18\r\nPortugal::M/16\r\nRussia::16+\r\nSaudi Arabia::R15\r\nSingapore::M18\r\nSouth Korea::18\r\nSpain::16\r\nSweden::15\r\nTurkey::18+\r\nUnited Kingdom::X\r\nUnited States::R\r\nUnited Arab Emirates::R\r\nWest Germany::16',18),(458,'12392504','Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story','Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story','Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story\r\nSCAM 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story\r\nScam 1992 the Harshad Mehta Story\r\nЖульничество 1992: История Харшада Мехты',2020,54,9.5,136209,'Hindi','India','Biography\r\nCrime\r\nDrama\r\nThriller','Hansal Mehta\r\nJai Mehta','Saurav Dey\r\nSumit Purohit\r\nSumit Purohit\r\nVaibhav Vishal\r\nVaibhav Vishal\r\nKaran Vyas\r\nKaran Vyas','Indranil Chakraborty\r\nPrasoon Garg\r\nKartik R.

IV. He begins working on Papaya, an app he is making for his deaf girlfriend Amaya: the app listens to the user\'s voice and posts their words on the screen. However, Amaya is upset because the app only makes it convenient for her to understand him, but not for him to understand her. Matias keeps getting messages for Norah from someone named Erica. He gets on a Skype video call with his friends - tech wiz Damon, conspiracy theorist and YouTube-personality AJ, DJ Lexx, and couple Serena and Nari - and becomes frustrated with the computer constantly restarting. Serena and Nari reveal that they just got engaged. Serena wishes she told her mom sooner because her mom is on life support due to brain cancer. Matias discovers that Erica is actually Norah.

As a result, seven of the accused ringleaders are arraigned on charges like Conspiracy by the hostile Nixon administration, including Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers who was not involved in the incident. What follows is an unfair trial presided by the belligerent Judge Hoffman (No relation) and prosecuted by a reluctant but duty-bound Richard Schultz. As their pro bono lawyers face such odds, Hayden and his fellows are frustrated by the Yippies\' outrageous antics undermining their defense in defiance of the system even while Seale is denied a chance to defend himself his way. Along the way, the Chicago 7 clash in their political philosophies even as they learn they need each other in this fight.\r\n-\r\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol1970@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nWhat was intended to be a peaceful protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention turned into a violent clash with police and the National Guard. The organizers of the protest--including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale--were charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. The trial that followed was one of the most notorious in history.\r\n-\r\nyusufpiskin\r\n\r\n1969. With the new Richard Nixon administration in the White House, US Attorney General John Mitchell proceeds to lay charges against Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, leaders of Students for Democratic Society, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, leaders of the Youth International Parties (Yippies or Young Hippies), David Dellinger, leader of Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam (The Mobe), individuals Lee Weiner and John Froines, and Bobby Seale, National Chair of the Black Panthers, under the never used Rap Brown Law: for \"conspiracy to cross state lines in order to incite violence\" for their roles in the protest outside the National Democratic Convention (DNC) in Chicago the summer previous, the protest which turned violent. The protest was against the United States\' escalating participation in the Vietnam War, the DNC chosen for then President Lyndon B. Johnson\'s doubling of troops almost overnight and the presumptive Democratic nominee for President, Hubert H. Humphrey, continuing such if elected. In part as they are using the same legal team of William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, the first seven are deemed the Chicago 7, with Seale the outsider for many reasons, including he being the only one of the eight a person of color. If convicted, they could serve a maximum penalty of ten years in prison. While the eight are aware of each other, some had never met before the protest and rarely collaborated. As such, the lead prosecutor, Richard Schultz, as does everyone else involved in this case, is aware that the charges and thus the trial are politically motivated rather than a matter of justice under the law, with each of the eight of the eight hundred or so protesters chosen for very specific political reasons, and as former Attorney General under Johnson, Ramsey Clark, had no intention of laying charges after the Justice Department\'s review.\r\n-\r\nHuggo\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the bloody events before and after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where unarmed protesters were pitted against armed-to-the-teeth police officers in Lincoln Park, Attorney General John Mitchell, appoints prosecutors, Richard Schultz and Tom Foran, to bring eight men to trial for inciting violence. In 1969, under Richard Nixon\'s presidency, eight alleged ringleaders faced charges of conspiracy and promoting riot. They were the Conspiracy Eight: Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, enthusiastic and silver-tongued leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society; Yippies, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, who ran the Youth International Party; radical pacifist and conscientious objector, David Dellinger; anti-war activist, John Froines; teaching assistant, Lee Weiner, and co-founder of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale, whose case was eventually declared a mistrial. Apart from Bobby Seale, all the defendants were represented by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, who were convinced that the charges are politically motivated. The judge was bigoted Julius Hoffman who refused to let the progressive, former U.S. Attorney General, Ramsey Clark, testify in front of the jury. But, who started the riots?

But something strange is happening in the village, and there\'s little time for mourning. The water supply has been cut off, animals are stampeding through the streets, and empty coffins are turning up on the roadside. One morning, the villagers wake up to find their home has disappeared from satellite maps completely. Under threat from an unknown enemy, Bacurau braces itself for a bloody, brutal fight for survival.\r\n\r\nA village consisting of very few close knitted people and suffering from severe water shortage experiences a series of unusual events after the arrival of two tourist bikers. The entire village\'s mobile signal goes down, the village\'s name n location suddenly disappears from online maps, a flying drone is seen hovering above n horses from nearby farm are set loose.\r\n-\r\nFella_shibby@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nNot knowing what to expect, Teresa returns home for the funeral of her grandmother, Carmelita. But there, in the remote Brazilian outback, corruption rules the arid, water-deprived, and seemingly nonexistent village of Bacurau: a tight-knit community forgotten by God and even Google Maps. Then, suddenly, Bacurau becomes a pole of attraction for mysterious visitors, and an imperceptible, insidious menace casts its dark shadow over the small settlement. Now, as cell phone service disappears and an unexpected object observes from afar, a string of strange occurrences alarms the pill-popping inhabitants.
